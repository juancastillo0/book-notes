## Music, Patronage, and the Public

Before, the arts was based on a patronage system. Renaissance in Italy took place under the Church and the ducal courts. Botticelli and Michelangelo were employed by the Medici family, dukes of Florence.

Engravings and printing in the 15th century gave access to a broader clientele.

> Music, perhaps more than any other art, had always been associated with direct patronage. [...] In court and Church, European musicians from Machaut to Monteverdi to J.S. Bach necessarily found their place.

The first musical entertainment that began to separate from the patronage was opera. The first house was opened in 1637, Venice. It was now possible for ordinary citizens to buy tickets to a staged performance. By the end of the 17th century, 9 opera houses were opened in Venice. In the late 17th century, Naples, Paris and Hamburg opened opera houses. It became the most popular musical entertainments in Europe.

By the 18th century, concerts came. In Italy they were mainly organized by the academies. By the end of the century, they invited audiences and became concert organizations. "Until well into the 19th century the ordinary word for 'concert' in Italy (and even Vienna) was 'academia'." 

In German-speaking countries, concerts came from more plebian surroundings. From organizations for amateur music making, "collegia musica". The quality improved, as more professional musicians were being hired. In Leipzig 1730s, J.S. Bach was the director. G.P. Teleman was the director for the organizations in Frankfurt and Hamburg. It became increasingly plain that the music was not in service of the Church and court, but in "capturing the interest of emergent educated, largely middle-class public."

England with its strong commerce and prosperous middle-class had musical performances being arranged in homes as early as 1672. By the end of the 18th century, one could find concerts each night at the height of the season (January-May).

French concerts came into being largely as a substitute for opera. The Concerts Spirituels, most prestigious of all Parisian concert organizations, were founded by the distinguished musician and chess player A.D. Philidor in 1725. Thought the century there were many other organizations.

### Public

In the later 18th century the word "public", in its modern meaning, took form.

> The very expression "public opinion" appeared in several languages at this time.

### Instruments

As increasing number of people had the means and leisure to indulge in arts, there was a dramatic increase in music making at home.

> The guitar enjoyed and enormous vogue all over Europe shortly after the mid of the century. But keyboard instruments exceeded all others in popularity, their great range and adaptability to all kinds of musical textures, thick or thin, contrapuntal or homophonic. In the second half od the 18th century as the pianoforte supplanted the older harpsichord and clavichord, additional dimensions of expressiveness in the new instrument made it irresistible to amateur players.

There were two pianos in the 18th century, "Viennese" (light, rapid action with a "nasal" sound) and "English". 

Mozart praised the Viennese pianos handsomely in 1777 Augsburg in the workshop of Johann Stein. During the following decades, Vienna became the center of a burgeoning industry in the construction of pianos after Stein's model.

Piano manufacturing in England began after the immigration of German instrument makers from Saxony during the Seven Years War (1756-63). In 1781 a scotsman, John Broadwood joined Tschudi's workshop, one of the immigrants. 

> The English piano (whose mechanism was originally from Italy by way of Germany) produced a sound more powerful and sonorous but less bright than that of the Viennese instrument. This design became the basis for the percussive and velvety sound of the 19th century pianoforte.

### Music Printing

Another business that benefitted from an enlarged literate public was music printing. About 1765 the Leipzig printer Immanuel Breitkopf invented a new typesetting method that made it possible to publish keyboard music and simple songs at volume and at a substantially lower price. In the late 18th century, easy piano pieces with voice, flute or violin, or piano alone, constituted the bulk of the offering for major publishers in Paris, Vienna, Leipzig and London. The publication of "professional music", such as full orchestras, was rare until the second quarter of the 19th century. At the end of the 18th century, these publishing houses started to address the public with musical periodicals (journals), most of them for the new musical public.

### Musicians Work and Patronage

For musicians, now it became possible to make a living by offering their services as free agents. Again, this happened earlier in England than elsewhere. The shift was also visible in the most famous composers of the period. Mozart's quarrels with his employer, the Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg, ended with the composer's resignation in 1781. The remaining 10 years of his life wew spent in free-lance composing, performing, and teaching in Vienna. Beethoven, though dependent upon commissions and stipends from the aristocracy, was never in the direct employment after he left the court at Vonn for Vienna in 1792. Haydn lived in both worlds, he continues as kapellmeister for Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy and in the 1790s, he embraces his life as a public musician as he conducted his symphonies at concerts in London.

There were precious few courts and Churches left in Europe with the means or prestige to maintain elaborate musical establishments or to attract important composers. There were exceptions, such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) at the Weimar court, Louis Spohr in Kassel, Liszt (1811-1886) spent many of his later years at the Weimar court, and Wagner was able to extract financial support fromm the King Ludwig II of Bavaria. **Genuine success meant public success.**

## The Composer's Training

Most composers in the 17th and early 18th century were taught inside their families for the Church or courts. Fathers would often pass the skills and positions within their family. One must ofter distinguish between 2 or more composers of the same name, Gabrielis of Venice, Scarlattis of Naples and Rome, Coupoerins and Philidors in France and Bachs in Thuringia and Saxony. Even Beethoven and Mozart learned at a young age in their family. 

With the disappearance of the patronage system, Most composers in the 19th century learned their craft later in life and by a different route. Schubert's and Chopin's fathers where schoolmasters. Schumann was the son of a bookseller. Berlioz's father was a doctor. Dvorak's family were innkeepers. Wagner's parents' profession is not clear, but they were not musicians. One exception to this rule is Felix Mendelssohn, which received training from his mother.

The typical 19th century composer has much less musical training early in life. "And therein lies one explanation for the dissipation of a 'central style' in th 19th century, and for the extraordinary diversity of Romantic music."

## Musical Aesthetics

> Philosophers of the time, such as Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer, set themselves to define the principles, goals, and significance of the arts as a cohesive community.

> For writers of the time aesthetics was a very serious business because art suddenly seemed more important than ever before.

After the undermining of the religious establishment in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Enlightenment provided a temporary refuge. The revolution and war between 1780 adn 1815, left the intellectual community in disarray and disillusionment. Others turned again to religion. 

> For others, specially in Germany, art took on the status of a kind of secular religion; it was widely thought to provide access to a level of reality that transcended the accidents and restrictions of a person's ordinary existence.

Shelley wrote:

> I am the eye with which the Universe\
> Beholds itself and knows itself divine;\
> All harmony of instrument or verse,\
> All prophecy, all medicine is mine,\
> All light of art or nature;â€”to my song\
> Victory and praise in its own right belong.

According to Schopenhauer, we can access the Will, the pattern or mold thought to underline all phenomena we experience, thought art, and music even circumvents that step. Since, it is the "immediate representation of the Will". Music offers us a glimpse to the most fundamental nature of the universe, unknowable in any other way.

It is unlikely that these ideas were heard by musicians. Yet Schuman was an avid reader and admirer of Hoffmann. Ideas similar to these were heard from 1810 onward, particularly in Germany.

> It was art that held me back. Ah it seemed to me impossible to leave the world until a had brought forth all that I felt was within me.
> 
> \- Beethoven

The Promethean of composers, as a firebringer from the gods to man gained wide currency among musicians and music critics earlier in the 19th century. Also contributed to the widening of the serious and popular music (art vs entertainment).

> For whom was he writing his works? For himself and a select company of connoisseurs, or perhaps for the enlightened posterity? Or perhaps for the anonymous public whose approval could bring popularity and a living wage?

Weber, Berlioz, Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner show signs of this struggle. One sign is the extraordinary volume of apologetic, didactic and downright propagandistic prose written by composers of the time.


## Historicism in Music

Historicism, the reassessment of historic events, in particular the Middle Ages, formerly despised, was subject to appreciative reinterpretations. There was a new admiration for Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes who stood outside the classical tradition canonized by French academic standards.

Works of art that depend on recreation though performance tend to have a short life expectancy. Music is more fragile than paintings or sculpture. In the late Middle Ages, music style tended to change from one generation to the next. Only a few manuscripts were preserved. Europeans seldom listened to music from previous generations. In the 18th century, Bach, Handel, Haydn were expected to deliver continuous successions of new work.

In the early 19th century, as the effect of Historicism was felt in music, concerts of older music started to be played. 

### Bach's revival and influence

The most spectacular of these recoveries, and more far reaching in its implications for music in the Romantic era, was the "Bach revival". He was largely unknown outside of Germany, until de publication of The Well-Tempered Clavier in 1800, with many others key works resurrected in the following decades.

The compositions if the 19th century were not only in competition with their contemporaries. 

> Schubert, Schumann and Brahms expressed discouragement at the prospect of writing quartets and symphonies after Beethoven. To a lesser extent for organ music after Bach and oratorios after Handel. The traditional categories of instrumental music were not extensively cultivated. Symphonies, sonatas, and concertos were to a considerable extent displaced by a proliferation of smaller types of indeterminate lineage: music related to the dance, fantasies, ballades, intermezzos, and the like.

Beethoven, Schuman and Brahms were strongly indebted to Bach's model for the formation and nurturing of they style. Composers of the 19th century tended to see Bach as an isolated genius.

> In respect to compositions in organ and piano, no one in his century can compare with him. To me, everything appears in comparison to the development of this giant figure as something conceived in childhood.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

> Mozart and Hayden had a partial one-sided knowledge of Bach. [...] The profound powers of combination,the poetry and humor of recent music have their origin largely in Bach. Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, all the so-called romantics (I mean Germans, of course) are in their music much closer to Bach than Mozart was.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

Romantic music's nourishment by older musicâ€”particularly Baroque compositional practiceâ€”was health and indispensable.

> The collective musical memory of forty years described by Tinctoris [in the late Middle Ages] was double and tripled and quadrupled as the 19th century advanced. A heightened consciousness of history informed and in some ways transformed the musical culture of the entire era.

## "Romantic"

In music criticism the word "romanic" has been used in the beginning of the 19th century, were it meant "abstract" or "indefinite" or "imaginative"â€” or simply modern as opposed to "ancient". 

> A preference to the original rather than the normative, a pursuit of unique effects and extremes of expressiveness, the mobilization to that end of an enriched harmonic vocabulary, striking new figurations, textures and tone colors.

"Romantic" is often paired with its supposed opposite, "classic". In 1836, the influential Leipzig music critic Amadeus Wendt distinguished a classic period consisting almost exclusively of the works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But it is probably a mistake to think of the classical period in opposition to the romantic. Characteristics of "classic" musicâ€”an implied metric regularity, a circumscribed diatonic harmonic syntax, a largely homophonic texture, and slow harmonic rhythmâ€”persist in large sectors of musical practice in th 19th century. And characteristic we think as "romantic" are found in the 18th century, C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Clementi.

Although there is no clear separation, here we shall begin from the compositions of the maturing Beethoven in Vienna after his move in 1792. Romantic musicians with near unanimity claimed him as their own.

However tortuous the course of his later style, Beethoven remained rooted in Viennese Classicism.

# Chapter 2: Beethoven in Vienna, 1792-1808

Beethoven, 22 years when he arrived to Vienna from Bonn, might seem to have no special advantages. He made some effort to acquire social graces, but his behavior was at times uncouth, and over the years became increasingly eccentric. However, Beethoven came recommended from Elector-Archbishop Maximilian Franz of Cologne, uncle of the current emperor, Leopold II, and Count Waldstein from Bonn.

Beethoven studied with Haydn for one year (1792). Haydn was, apparently, not very conscientious about the lessons. Relations remained distant until Haydn's death in 1809.

Beethoven had two other teachers during his early years in Vienna: Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, with whom he continued his study of counterpoint, and Antonio Salieri, who coached him in Italian declamation.

In 1795 he began to appear in public concerts. He had marvelous ability to improvise and engaged in multiple contests with pianists such as Clementi, Gelinek, Wolfl, Steibelt.

The first houses in which he lived in Vienna was that of Prince Lichnowsky, who became his foremost patron.

## Early Stylistics Growth: Piano Sonatas

Beethoven's musical imagination was tied to the newest keyboard instrument, the piano.

Piano sonatas of Opus 2, finished in 1795, show a departure from the norms of Classical style. An adaptation of the Piano Quartet, an example of a "Accompanied keyboard sonata", one of the most common musical genres of the late 18th century. Rhe style was also changed from a regular melodic structure.

In *PathÃ©tique Sonata*, Opus 13 changes the left-hand accompaniment broken-octave or *murky* bass.

Pianos sonatas before Beethoven had typically three movements (fast-slow-fast), or after the Italian manner, of only two (usually fast-faster). In Sonata Op. 26 (1800-01) he began with an Andante theme and variations, and substituting a lugubrious funeral march for the usual slow movement. Beethoven in 1800 "I am not very well satisfied with the work I have done thus far. I shall take a new way." In the 1790s the maturity accelerated noticeably. The central body of his compositions was centered around the piano, however, it began to relinquish its grip on his musical imagination.

A-major Quartet of Beethoven's Opus 18 was modeled after Mozart's Quartet in A-major, K. 464. The sixth quartet of Opus 18, differs from the others with an Adagio introduction to the Allegro finale (slow introductions to first movements were much more common). Long-held chords played alternatively *piano* and *forte* combine with extreme registral shifts. Adagio fragments are inserted into the Allegro, falling well outside the usual norms of Classic style.

## The Tempest Sonata, Op 31 No 2

Czerny mentioned these compositions as representative of Beethoven's "new way". Of the various sonatas, only *PathÃ©tique* (Op. 13) and *Levewohl* (Op 81a) were named by Beethoven. Op 31's *Tempest* comes from Shakespeare's Tempest. Beginning feels improvisatory, however the music is used throughout the movement. Op 31 No 2, in which the melody is divided between lower and upper registers with a rapid oscillating accompaniment in the middle is quite unlike standard Viennese piano writing of the time. In multiple works, certain stylistic decisions can be traced back to Muzio Clementi.

31 years old in Vienna 1802, Beethoven entered a productive period. Beethoven took long daily walks with a pocket-sized sketchbook. 

## The Eroica Symphony

Probably the longest symphony ever written at that point and the first, in that period of 6 years, that inspired and intimidated Beethoven's followers in the 19th century and beyond.

"More unorthodox than its harmonic scheme is the number and nature of melodic motives in this exposition. [...] Another salient feature of this exposition a determined disruption of meter. Beginning in m. 25 harmonic and melodic interest are minimal, and the listener's attention is focused upon powerful accents falling regularly in patterns of two beats in contradiction to the 3/4 meter." Some 35 years later, the decidedly avant-garde composer and critic Hector Belioz (1803-69) found such procedures shocking.

The second movement, Marcia funebre (Funeral March) is modeled after the grand dirges played at the funeral for heroes of the revolution and Napoleonic wars. Such marches where composed in the 1970s by French composers of the day such as Francois Joseph Gossec (1734-1829), Ã‰tienne-Nicolas MÃ©hul (1763-1817), and Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842). Very slow tempo, minor mode, imitations of drumrolls, and pervasive dotter rhythms characteristic od Republican funeral music. Beethoven was apparently fond of the melody and bass starting in m. 75: he had already used both as thematic material for his Piano Variations Op. 35 nad several early pieces. 

The "hero" Beethoven originally intended to celebrate in the Erotica was Napoleon. However, upon knowing that he had proclaimed himself emperor Beethoven removed the dedication, according to Ries and Schindler. In 1805 Napoleon's troops captured Vienna, this may be another reason for the change in dedication.

## Fidelio

Beethoven's only opera. Its libretto was provided by the Republican France. The opera adheres to the conventions of French opÃ©ra comique and German Singspiel. Prince Lichnowsky, Stephan von Breuning, the tenor Joseph August Rockel and others persuaded him to revise the opera en 1805. In 1808, the second revision was given and this time the critics were kinder. However, displeased with the performances and suspecting deliberate sabotage of his work by certain "enemies", he withdrew it from stage. With more revisions the opera was revived in 1814. This time text was provided by Georg Friedrich Treitschke and Beethoven conducting as at the first performance, it was a resounding success.

Beethoven never wrote another opera and Fidelio cost him enormous effort, it was clear that great victories were more easily achieved in other battlegrounds. This work stands as a monument to the composer's genius in the face of enormous odds. The primary obstacle in this case was the weaknesses  in the musical-dramatic structure of the opera.  For some the most valuable legacy was the instrumental music. 

> The Leonore Overtures Nos. 2 and 3, though judged even by Beethoven too overwhelming for an operatic introduction, hold a central place in the canon of his works from these splendid years of orchestral composition. In this area, his triumph was complete.

# Chapter 3: Beethoven: The Late Years, 1809-27

In May 1809 Napoleon's armies invaded Vienna, but unlike 1806, the invasion was resisted. The nobility left an, by May 12, the army entered Vienna. 

The French occupation and Beethoven's health affected his productivity in the following years. Colitis and local infections. His deafness, first evident in 1797, increase inexorable. He used "ear trumpets" and from 1816 he used conversation books.

His brother Gaspar Carl died in 1815 and he took guardianship of his son. He did not think his mother would be fit as a guardian.

Reclusiveness came to dominate Beethoven's life. In 1818 he wrote in his diary:

> Sacrifice once and for all the trivialities of social life to your art

The economy of the Hapsburg empire collapsed and Beethoven's sources of income were curtailed. In 1809, Archduke Rudolph, Princes Kinsky and Lobkowitz, concerned that he might leave the city, gave him a lifetime annuity of 4000 florins. However, the currency devaluated an 80%. In 1811 Lobkowitz ceased to pay and Kinsky died in 1812.

The year of the "second invasion" 1809 was still a productive year. In 1812 he finished both his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies. However, until 1823, he did not finished more than one major composition. Fifth in 1808 contains heaven-storming crescendos and echoes of French Revolutionary music, continues the "heroic" manner of the Third. Sixth (the *Pastoral*), is utterly different with programmatic titles for each movement ("The awakening of happy feelings upon arriving in the country", "Scene at the brook", "A jolly meeting of country folk", and the like). In 1812, the Seventh returns to the urgency and energy associated with Beethoven odd-numbered symphonies and the Eighth is an intentionally slighter work.

In the summer of 1812 Napoleon embarked on his disastrous Russian campaign. After a hasty regrouping, the French were beaten by Wellington at Vittoria in Spain on June 21 1813. It now seemed safe for the Hapsburg government to join the nations united against Napoleon.

Beethoven, along with Johann Nepomuk Malzel, wrote a "battle piece", called Wellington's Victory, to commemorate Napoleon's downfall. From the point of view of the Viennese public, always fickle and sometimes, as Beethoven and other complained, shallow in their judgement, The *Battle Symphony* was the composer's finest triumph. Beethoven gained certain benefits from the popularity: his Seventh Symphony was given repeated performances and and the way now stood clear for the 1814 revival of Fidelio.

The metronome was invented by F. N . Winkel and not by Malzel.

Like other composers of his time, such as Haydn, Clementi, Pleyel, and Kozuluch, Beethoven produced his share of "amateur music" intended for home performance and quick sale. Examples of this misuc are the arrangements of Scottish Airs and the Variations for piano with optional flute or violin, Opp. 105 and 107.
