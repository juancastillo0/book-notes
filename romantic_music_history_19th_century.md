David Hume, Pain... Critics of the Christian institution.

## Music, Patronage, and the Public

Before, the arts was based on a patronage system. Renaissance in Italy took place under the Church and the ducal courts. Botticelli and Michelangelo were employed by the Medici family, dukes of Florence.

Engravings and printing in the 15th century gave access to a broader clientele.

> Music, perhaps more than any other art, had always been associated with direct patronage. [...] In court and Church, European musicians from Machaut to Monteverdi to J.S. Bach necessarily found their place.

The first musical entertainment that began to separate from the patronage was opera. The first house was opened in 1637, Venice. It was now possible for ordinary citizens to buy tickets to a staged performance. By the end of the 17th century, 9 opera houses were opened in Venice. In the late 17th century, Naples, Paris and Hamburg opened opera houses. It became the most popular musical entertainments in Europe.

By the 18th century, concerts came. In Italy they were mainly organized by the academies. By the end of the century, they invited audiences and became concert organizations. "Until well into the 19th century the ordinary word for 'concert' in Italy (and even Vienna) was 'academia'." 

In German-speaking countries, concerts came from more plebian surroundings. From organizations for amateur music making, "collegia musica". The quality improved, as more professional musicians were being hired. In Leipzig 1730s, J.S. Bach was the director. G.P. Teleman was the director for the organizations in Frankfurt and Hamburg. It became increasingly plain that the music was not in service of the Church and court, but in "capturing the interest of emergent educated, largely middle-class public."

England with its strong commerce and prosperous middle-class had musical performances being arranged in homes as early as 1672. By the end of the 18th century, one could find concerts each night at the height of the season (January-May).

French concerts came into being largely as a substitute for opera. The Concerts Spirituels, most prestigious of all Parisian concert organizations, were founded by the distinguished musician and chess player A.D. Philidor in 1725. Thought the century there were many other organizations.

### Public

In the later 18th century the word "public", in its modern meaning, took form.

> The very expression "public opinion" appeared in several languages at this time.

### Instruments

As increasing number of people had the means and leisure to indulge in arts, there was a dramatic increase in music making at home.

> The guitar enjoyed and enormous vogue all over Europe shortly after the mid of the century. But keyboard instruments exceeded all others in popularity, their great range and adaptability to all kinds of musical textures, thick or thin, contrapuntal or homophonic. In the second half od the 18th century as the pianoforte supplanted the older harpsichord and clavichord, additional dimensions of expressiveness in the new instrument made it irresistible to amateur players.

There were two pianos in the 18th century, "Viennese" (light, rapid action with a "nasal" sound) and "English". 

Mozart praised the Viennese pianos handsomely in 1777 Augsburg in the workshop of Johann Stein. During the following decades, Vienna became the center of a burgeoning industry in the construction of pianos after Stein's model.

Piano manufacturing in England began after the immigration of German instrument makers from Saxony during the Seven Years War (1756-63). In 1781 a scotsman, John Broadwood joined Tschudi's workshop, one of the immigrants. 

> The English piano (whose mechanism was originally from Italy by way of Germany) produced a sound more powerful and sonorous but less bright than that of the Viennese instrument. This design became the basis for the percussive and velvety sound of the 19th century pianoforte.

### Music Printing

Another business that benefitted from an enlarged literate public was music printing. About 1765 the Leipzig printer Immanuel Breitkopf invented a new typesetting method that made it possible to publish keyboard music and simple songs at volume and at a substantially lower price. In the late 18th century, easy piano pieces with voice, flute or violin, or piano alone, constituted the bulk of the offering for major publishers in Paris, Vienna, Leipzig and London. The publication of "professional music", such as full orchestras, was rare until the second quarter of the 19th century. At the end of the 18th century, these publishing houses started to address the public with musical periodicals (journals), most of them for the new musical public.

### Musicians Work and Patronage

For musicians, now it became possible to make a living by offering their services as free agents. Again, this happened earlier in England than elsewhere. The shift was also visible in the most famous composers of the period. Mozart's quarrels with his employer, the Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg, ended with the composer's resignation in 1781. The remaining 10 years of his life wew spent in free-lance composing, performing, and teaching in Vienna. Beethoven, though dependent upon commissions and stipends from the aristocracy, was never in the direct employment after he left the court at Vonn for Vienna in 1792. Haydn lived in both worlds, he continues as kapellmeister for Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy and in the 1790s, he embraces his life as a public musician as he conducted his symphonies at concerts in London.

There were precious few courts and Churches left in Europe with the means or prestige to maintain elaborate musical establishments or to attract important composers. There were exceptions, such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) at the Weimar court, Louis Spohr in Kassel, Liszt (1811-1886) spent many of his later years at the Weimar court, and Wagner was able to extract financial support fromm the King Ludwig II of Bavaria. **Genuine success meant public success.**

## The Composer's Training

Most composers in the 17th and early 18th century were taught inside their families for the Church or courts. Fathers would often pass the skills and positions within their family. One must ofter distinguish between 2 or more composers of the same name, Gabrielis of Venice, Scarlattis of Naples and Rome, Coupoerins and Philidors in France and Bachs in Thuringia and Saxony. Even Beethoven and Mozart learned at a young age in their family. 

With the disappearance of the patronage system, Most composers in the 19th century learned their craft later in life and by a different route. Schubert's and Chopin's fathers where schoolmasters. Schumann was the son of a bookseller. Berlioz's father was a doctor. Dvorak's family were innkeepers. Wagner's parents' profession is not clear, but they were not musicians. One exception to this rule is Felix Mendelssohn, which received training from his mother.

The typical 19th century composer has much less musical training early in life. "And therein lies one explanation for the dissipation of a 'central style' in th 19th century, and for the extraordinary diversity of Romantic music."

## Musical Aesthetics

> Philosophers of the time, such as Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer, set themselves to define the principles, goals, and significance of the arts as a cohesive community.

> For writers of the time aesthetics was a very serious business because art suddenly seemed more important than ever before.

After the undermining of the religious establishment in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Enlightenment provided a temporary refuge. The revolution and war between 1780 adn 1815, left the intellectual community in disarray and disillusionment. Others turned again to religion. 

> For others, specially in Germany, art took on the status of a kind of secular religion; it was widely thought to provide access to a level of reality that transcended the accidents and restrictions of a person's ordinary existence.

Shelley wrote:

> I am the eye with which the Universe\
> Beholds itself and knows itself divine;\
> All harmony of instrument or verse,\
> All prophecy, all medicine is mine,\
> All light of art or nature;—to my song\
> Victory and praise in its own right belong.

According to Schopenhauer, we can access the Will, the pattern or mold thought to underline all phenomena we experience, thought art, and music even circumvents that step. Since, it is the "immediate representation of the Will". Music offers us a glimpse to the most fundamental nature of the universe, unknowable in any other way.

It is unlikely that these ideas were heard by musicians. Yet Schuman was an avid reader and admirer of Hoffmann. Ideas similar to these were heard from 1810 onward, particularly in Germany.

> It was art that held me back. Ah it seemed to me impossible to leave the world until a had brought forth all that I felt was within me.
> 
> \- Beethoven

The Promethean of composers, as a firebringer from the gods to man gained wide currency among musicians and music critics earlier in the 19th century. Also contributed to the widening of the serious and popular music (art vs entertainment).

> For whom was he writing his works? For himself and a select company of connoisseurs, or perhaps for the enlightened posterity? Or perhaps for the anonymous public whose approval could bring popularity and a living wage?

Weber, Berlioz, Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner show signs of this struggle. One sign is the extraordinary volume of apologetic, didactic and downright propagandistic prose written by composers of the time.


## Historicism in Music

Historicism, the reassessment of historic events, in particular the Middle Ages, formerly despised, was subject to appreciative reinterpretations. There was a new admiration for Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes who stood outside the classical tradition canonized by French academic standards.

Works of art that depend on recreation though performance tend to have a short life expectancy. Music is more fragile than paintings or sculpture. In the late Middle Ages, music style tended to change from one generation to the next. Only a few manuscripts were preserved. Europeans seldom listened to music from previous generations. In the 18th century, Bach, Handel, Haydn were expected to deliver continuous successions of new work.

In the early 19th century, as the effect of Historicism was felt in music, concerts of older music started to be played. 

### Bach's revival and influence

The most spectacular of these recoveries, and more far reaching in its implications for music in the Romantic era, was the "Bach revival". He was largely unknown outside of Germany, until de publication of The Well-Tempered Clavier in 1800, with many others key works resurrected in the following decades.

The compositions if the 19th century were not only in competition with their contemporaries. 

> Schubert, Schumann and Brahms expressed discouragement at the prospect of writing quartets and symphonies after Beethoven. To a lesser extent for organ music after Bach and oratorios after Handel. The traditional categories of instrumental music were not extensively cultivated. Symphonies, sonatas, and concertos were to a considerable extent displaced by a proliferation of smaller types of indeterminate lineage: music related to the dance, fantasies, ballades, intermezzos, and the like.

Beethoven, Schuman and Brahms were strongly indebted to Bach's model for the formation and nurturing of they style. Composers of the 19th century tended to see Bach as an isolated genius.

> In respect to compositions in organ and piano, no one in his century can compare with him. To me, everything appears in comparison to the development of this giant figure as something conceived in childhood.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

> Mozart and Hayden had a partial one-sided knowledge of Bach. [...] The profound powers of combination,the poetry and humor of recent music have their origin largely in Bach. Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, all the so-called romantics (I mean Germans, of course) are in their music much closer to Bach than Mozart was.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

Romantic music's nourishment by older music—particularly Baroque compositional practice—was health and indispensable.

> The collective musical memory of forty years described by Tinctoris [in the late Middle Ages] was double and tripled and quadrupled as the 19th century advanced. A heightened consciousness of history informed and in some ways transformed the musical culture of the entire era.

## "Romantic"

In music criticism the word "romanic" has been used in the beginning of the 19th century, were it meant "abstract" or "indefinite" or "imaginative"— or simply modern as opposed to "ancient". 

> A preference to the original rather than the normative, a pursuit of unique effects and extremes of expressiveness, the mobilization to that end of an enriched harmonic vocabulary, striking new figurations, textures and tone colors.

"Romantic" is often paired with its supposed opposite, "classic". In 1836, the influential Leipzig music critic Amadeus Wendt distinguished a classic period consisting almost exclusively of the works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But it is probably a mistake to think of the classical period in opposition to the romantic. Characteristics of "classic" music—an implied metric regularity, a circumscribed diatonic harmonic syntax, a largely homophonic texture, and slow harmonic rhythm—persist in large sectors of musical practice in th 19th century. And characteristic we think as "romantic" are found in the 18th century, C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Clementi.

Although there is no clear separation, here we shall begin from the compositions of the maturing Beethoven in Vienna after his move in 1792. Romantic musicians with near unanimity claimed him as their own.

However tortuous the course of his later style, Beethoven remained rooted in Viennese Classicism.

# Chapter 2: Beethoven in Vienna, 1792-1808

Beethoven, 22 years when he arrived to Vienna from Bonn, might seem to have no special advantages. He made some effort to acquire social graces, but his behavior was at times uncouth, and over the years became increasingly eccentric. However, Beethoven came recommended from Elector-Archbishop Maximilian Franz of Cologne, uncle of the current emperor, Leopold II, and Count Waldstein from Bonn.

Beethoven studied with Haydn for one year (1792). Haydn was, apparently, not very conscientious about the lessons. Relations remained distant until Haydn's death in 1809.

Beethoven had two other teachers during his early years in Vienna: Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, with whom he continued his study of counterpoint, and Antonio Salieri, who coached him in Italian declamation.

In 1795 he began to appear in public concerts. He had marvelous ability to improvise and engaged in multiple contests with pianists such as Clementi, Gelinek, Wolfl, Steibelt.

The first houses in which he lived in Vienna was that of Prince Lichnowsky, who became his foremost patron.

## Early Stylistics Growth: Piano Sonatas

Beethoven's musical imagination was tied to the newest keyboard instrument, the piano.

Piano sonatas of Opus 2, finished in 1795, show a departure from the norms of Classical style. An adaptation of the Piano Quartet, an example of a "Accompanied keyboard sonata", one of the most common musical genres of the late 18th century. Rhe style was also changed from a regular melodic structure.

In *Pathétique Sonata*, Opus 13 changes the left-hand accompaniment broken-octave or *murky* bass.

Pianos sonatas before Beethoven had typically three movements (fast-slow-fast), or after the Italian manner, of only two (usually fast-faster). In Sonata Op. 26 (1800-01) he began with an Andante theme and variations, and substituting a lugubrious funeral march for the usual slow movement. Beethoven in 1800 "I am not very well satisfied with the work I have done thus far. I shall take a new way." In the 1790s the maturity accelerated noticeably. The central body of his compositions was centered around the piano, however, it began to relinquish its grip on his musical imagination.

A-major Quartet of Beethoven's Opus 18 was modeled after Mozart's Quartet in A-major, K. 464. The sixth quartet of Opus 18, differs from the others with an Adagio introduction to the Allegro finale (slow introductions to first movements were much more common). Long-held chords played alternatively *piano* and *forte* combine with extreme registral shifts. Adagio fragments are inserted into the Allegro, falling well outside the usual norms of Classic style.

## The Tempest Sonata, Op 31 No 2

Czerny mentioned these compositions as representative of Beethoven's "new way". Of the various sonatas, only *Pathétique* (Op. 13) and *Levewohl* (Op 81a) were named by Beethoven. Op 31's *Tempest* comes from Shakespeare's Tempest. Beginning feels improvisatory, however the music is used throughout the movement. Op 31 No 2, in which the melody is divided between lower and upper registers with a rapid oscillating accompaniment in the middle is quite unlike standard Viennese piano writing of the time. In multiple works, certain stylistic decisions can be traced back to Muzio Clementi.

31 years old in Vienna 1802, Beethoven entered a productive period. Beethoven took long daily walks with a pocket-sized sketchbook. 

## The Eroica Symphony

Probably the longest symphony ever written at that point and the first, in that period of 6 years, that inspired and intimidated Beethoven's followers in the 19th century and beyond.

"More unorthodox than its harmonic scheme is the number and nature of melodic motives in this exposition. [...] Another salient feature of this exposition a determined disruption of meter. Beginning in m. 25 harmonic and melodic interest are minimal, and the listener's attention is focused upon powerful accents falling regularly in patterns of two beats in contradiction to the 3/4 meter." Some 35 years later, the decidedly avant-garde composer and critic Hector Belioz (1803-69) found such procedures shocking.

The second movement, Marcia funebre (Funeral March) is modeled after the grand dirges played at the funeral for heroes of the revolution and Napoleonic wars. Such marches where composed in the 1970s by French composers of the day such as Francois Joseph Gossec (1734-1829), Étienne-Nicolas Méhul (1763-1817), and Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842). Very slow tempo, minor mode, imitations of drumrolls, and pervasive dotter rhythms characteristic od Republican funeral music. Beethoven was apparently fond of the melody and bass starting in m. 75: he had already used both as thematic material for his Piano Variations Op. 35 nad several early pieces. 

The "hero" Beethoven originally intended to celebrate in the Erotica was Napoleon. However, upon knowing that he had proclaimed himself emperor Beethoven removed the dedication, according to Ries and Schindler. In 1805 Napoleon's troops captured Vienna, this may be another reason for the change in dedication.

## Fidelio

Beethoven's only opera. Its libretto was provided by the Republican France. The opera adheres to the conventions of French opéra comique and German Singspiel. Prince Lichnowsky, Stephan von Breuning, the tenor Joseph August Rockel and others persuaded him to revise the opera en 1805. In 1808, the second revision was given and this time the critics were kinder. However, displeased with the performances and suspecting deliberate sabotage of his work by certain "enemies", he withdrew it from stage. With more revisions the opera was revived in 1814. This time text was provided by Georg Friedrich Treitschke and Beethoven conducting as at the first performance, it was a resounding success.

Beethoven never wrote another opera and Fidelio cost him enormous effort, it was clear that great victories were more easily achieved in other battlegrounds. This work stands as a monument to the composer's genius in the face of enormous odds. The primary obstacle in this case was the weaknesses  in the musical-dramatic structure of the opera.  For some the most valuable legacy was the instrumental music. 

> The Leonore Overtures Nos. 2 and 3, though judged even by Beethoven too overwhelming for an operatic introduction, hold a central place in the canon of his works from these splendid years of orchestral composition. In this area, his triumph was complete.

# Chapter 3: Beethoven: The Late Years, 1809-27

In May 1809 Napoleon's armies invaded Vienna, but unlike 1806, the invasion was resisted. The nobility left an, by May 12, the army entered Vienna. 

The French occupation and Beethoven's health affected his productivity in the following years. Colitis and local infections. His deafness, first evident in 1797, increase inexorable. He used "ear trumpets" and from 1816 he used conversation books.

His brother Gaspar Carl died in 1815 and he took guardianship of his son. He did not think his mother would be fit as a guardian.

Reclusiveness came to dominate Beethoven's life. In 1818 he wrote in his diary:

> Sacrifice once and for all the trivialities of social life to your art

The economy of the Hapsburg empire collapsed and Beethoven's sources of income were curtailed. In 1809, Archduke Rudolph, Princes Kinsky and Lobkowitz, concerned that he might leave the city, gave him a lifetime annuity of 4000 florins. However, the currency devaluated an 80%. In 1811 Lobkowitz ceased to pay and Kinsky died in 1812.

The year of the "second invasion" 1809 was still a productive year. In 1812 he finished both his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies. However, until 1823, he did not finished more than one major composition. Fifth in 1808 contains heaven-storming crescendos and echoes of French Revolutionary music, continues the "heroic" manner of the Third. Sixth (the *Pastoral*), is utterly different with programmatic titles for each movement ("The awakening of happy feelings upon arriving in the country", "Scene at the brook", "A jolly meeting of country folk", and the like). In 1812, the Seventh returns to the urgency and energy associated with Beethoven odd-numbered symphonies and the Eighth is an intentionally slighter work.

In the summer of 1812 Napoleon embarked on his disastrous Russian campaign. After a hasty regrouping, the French were beaten by Wellington at Vittoria in Spain on June 21 1813. It now seemed safe for the Hapsburg government to join the nations united against Napoleon.

Beethoven, along with Johann Nepomuk Malzel, wrote a "battle piece", called Wellington's Victory, to commemorate Napoleon's downfall. From the point of view of the Viennese public, always fickle and sometimes, as Beethoven and other complained, shallow in their judgement, The *Battle Symphony* was the composer's finest triumph. Beethoven gained certain benefits from the popularity: his Seventh Symphony was given repeated performances and and the way now stood clear for the 1814 revival of Fidelio.

---
The metronome was invented by F. N . Winkel and not by Malzel.

---

Like other composers of his time, such as Haydn, Clementi, Pleyel, and Kozuluch, Beethoven produced his share of "amateur music" intended for home performance and quick sale. Examples of this misuc are the arrangements of Scottish Airs and the Variations for piano with optional flute or violin, Opp. 105 and 107.


## Formation of the Late Style

In the early years, Beethoven had worked out his compositional problems at the piano. Now, in his mid-forties, chronically ipp, deaf, and engulfed in personal difficulties, he once showed signs of a major shift in style. Almost five years intervened between the *Lebewohl Sonata* Op. 81a, and the next piano sonata, Opus 90 in E minor, finished in 1814.

In the second of the two sonatas for Cello and Piano, Op. 102, an Allegro fugato whose first subject is clearly derivative of Baroque contrapuntual practice. The occur more usually in minor, as in J.S. Bach's *Musical Offering* of 1747. Mozart and Beethoven had written similar contrapuntual subjects as early as 1795.

Some of Beethoven's older contemporaries turned to musical styles of the Baroque for enrichment and sustenance. Haydn in 1770s, Clementi in 1780, and Mozart some 3 years later. Though well schooled in J.S. Bach's *Will-Tempered Clavier* in Bonn, his formal education in contrapuntual writing seems to have began with his move to Vienna in 1792. From about 1815 to the end of his life, fugal and contrapuntal procedures are tightly woven into the entire fabric of Beethoven's compositional practice.

## The Diabelli Variations

Another fascination in the late career are formal variations. Two of his last three piano sonatas, Op. 109 and Op. 110, end climatically with variations (the other, Op. 110, is fugal).

In 1819 the Viennese publisher Anotonio Diabelli invited leading composers to submit one variation on each waltz theme he had written. Beethoven at first refused. Early in 1819 he sketched several variations and and progressed throughout the years to 35 variations.

> When late in life Beethoven plunged headlong into the techniques of fugue and variation, hea was operation at both extremes of a stylistic spectrum. Fugue meant rigorous, strict style, associated often with church music and sometimes bearing connotations of dry academicism. Theme-and-variations, on the other hand, suggested amateur music—music for polite diversion and even for pleasing background noise. What these very unlikely types had in common is that they placed severe restrictions upon the composer.

> Whatever his continued alliance to the sonata, fugue, and theme-and-variations, Beethoven now bends their shapes to radically new ends. Boundaries between forms grows indistinct. Sonata-allegro and theme-and-variations types are elaborately mingled and fugues show the development of motives associated with sonata movements. And here, as nowhere else in the repertory, we feel the force of the Romantic notion of music as a "speech above verbal speech", as an expression of the inexpressible.

## The Missa Solemnis and Ninth Symphony

The two biggest compositions of Beethoven's last years (finished in 1823 and 1824).

In June 1819 is was announced that Archuke Rudolf was to be appointed Archbishop of the moravian city Olmutz, Beethoven wrote to him, "The day on which a High Mass composed by me will be performed during the ceremonies solemnized for your Imperial Highness will be the most glorious day of my life". In preparation for his task, Beethoven apparently buried himself in antiquarian studies. The Archduke's library provided examples of polyphonic Masses from the 16th century to his own time. He acquainted himself with the church modes of medieval plainsong and sought out traditional theoretical works on church music, such as the *Institutioni harmoniche* (1558) of Gioseffo Zarlino. When he began actual composition, titanic combat with this relatively unfamiliar genre ensued.

The fugue at the end of Gloria (mm. 440ff.) is a technical tour-de-force were the first 19 measures are set over a dominant pedal. Fugal and contrapuntal writing are ots ordinary language; imitative openings are standard for both chorus and soloists in all movements. 

The Ninth Symphony underwent a gestation period longer even than that of the *Missa solemnis*. It seemingly resulted from ideas for three different compositions, an entirely instrumental symphony, another one incorporating voices (10th symphony), and a setting of Schiller's poem.

> Be embrace, ye millions!\
> This kiss to the whole world!\
> Brothers—above the starry canopy\
> A Loving Father must dwell.

Such expansive sentiments of mingled humanism and religiosity might be expected to appeal to the composer.

> Let him who has ventured\
> To be friend of a friend,\
> Let him who has embrace a pretty girl\
> Add his joy to ours!

It was characteristic of Beethoven that he should be attracted to such homely expressions of humane impulses. Indeed the Freude theme itself seems intentionally "common." The ordinary generous sentiments of ordinary people, Beethoven seems to be saying in the finale of the Ninth, offer the best hope for mankind.

> In the view of musicians of the following generations, Beethoven seemed to be saying something else as well—that with this composition he had exhausted the expressive resources of the instrumental symphony, that he had burst its restraining boundaries by introducing text and voices.

> [...] the musical poem is urging toward a crisis, a crisis only to be voices in human speech. It is wonderful how the master makes the arrival of Man's voice and tongue a positive necessity, by this awe-inspiring recitative in the bass-strings.
> 
> \- Wagner

Such assessments were taken very seriously by later composers; Many such as Mendelsshon, Berlioz, and Mahler, followed his example in writing with vocal movements.

The use of soloists and chorus in a symphony was per se new and startling in 1824. However, the Ninth is reminiscent of Beethoven;s work of former years. The first movement and Scherzo extend the "heroic" tradition. And the finale shows echoes of the massive musical celebrations of the French revolution. Only the slow movement with its subtle alternation of two marvelous themes, seem to belong wholly to the composer's final period. Is is a supreme example of the composer's late "contemplative" style, and one of the finest melodies Beethoven ever wrote.

## The Late Quartets

In November 1822, Prince Nicholas Galitsin offered to commission "one, two, or three new quartets", and Beethoven deeply engrossed in the Missa solemnis ans Ninth Symphone, quickly accepted. Beethoven was already comtemplating a new quartet and from 1824 until his death, Beethoven devoted himself with rare single-mindedness to composing this most demanding and sophisticated of ensembles.

Only one of the three quartest for Galitsin was published during the composers lifetime. 

Early in December 1826 on a journey from his beother Johann's home in Gneixendorf back in Vienna, he fell seriously ill he subsequently underwent four operations and finally died, apparently from a collapse of liver function, on March 1827.

> The string quartet is thoroughly amenable to contrapuntal writing, and it provides an uncluttered medium for the exposition  of Beethoven's most advanced ideas in harmonic motion and thematic transformation.

Metrical and harmonic regularity is maintained to an astonishing degree nearly thought the movement. Having chosen to impose these strictures upon himself, Beethoven explores textures, extreme ranges, and kaleidoscopic instrumental combinations.

## Contemporary Assessment

Thoughout much of his adult life Beethoven was the most respected composer in Europe. His orchestral works quickly became standard fare at concerts everywhere except in France. At the funeral procession for this reclusive and misanthropic man the crowd in attendance was estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people.

Beginning with the first works of his maturity, shortly after 1800, Beethoven's music evoked from some qaurters a continuing litany of exasperated criticism. Too long, difficult, obscure, exxentric, and bizarre (or according to contemporary usage, "baroque"). In a private concert in Vienna of 1805 a reviewer wrote about Eroica:

> [...] It often loses itself in lawlessness... The reviewer belongs to Herr van Beethoven's sincerest admirers, but in this composition he must confess that he finds took much that is glaring and bizarre.

Beginning about 1804, a different straub of Betthoven criticism made an appearance. Anonymous authors make attempts to penetrate the aesthetic obscurities of Beethoven's music. In these reviews—most particularly in the introduction to that on the Fifth Symphony—Hoffmann provides a new approach to understanding Beethoven, as well as a central document in Romantic musical aesthetics.

As Beethoven grew older, his music divered even more markedly from his contemporaries. In 1824, a review of the Piano Sonata Op. 109 read:

> It cannot be denied that he withdraws increasingly within himself, and thus ever more absent himself even from the pursuits and interests of other music lovers. He reveals only his own subjective thoughts, and in his composing pays heed to nothing but his own inspiration.

A genuine masterpiece must be unique and at the same time exemplary. Beethoven's instrumental compositions were seen as both for the entire 19th century.

> In the view of many he held proprietary rights for vast areas of composition—the symphony, the sonata, the string quartet, and perhaps the piano concerto. And the man himself, a voluntary exile from society who seemed to follow inner lights of extraterrestrial origin, easily became a prototype for the Romantic artist, and the founder, by general consent, of Romantic music.


# Chapter 4: Beethoven's Contemporaries: Instrumental Music

Beethoven devoted enormous energies to traditional large-scale instrumental compositions in a time when this sort of music was passing out of fasion. Many of the symphones heard during the early 1800s were written in the previous century. The works of Haydn and Mozart predominated at first; only Beethoven's symphones rivaled theirs in international popularity. Others such as Clementi were performed in special occasions.

Orchestral music of Beethoven's contemporaries, even the yournger ones, was for the most part conservative.

The popularity of traditional types of chamber musci also suffered a precipitous decline in the new century. In the 1810s and 1820s there was still some enthusiasm in Paris for chamber mmusic for strings and winds.

## Schubert

The greatest composer among Beethoven's contemporaries was Franz Schubert (1797-1828). Vienna just after the Congress of 1814-15 was a place of celebration and easy gaiety. Countless coffe houses and inns were filled day and night with people who had time to relax, read, and talk. 

Amateur musical ensembles flourished among the bourgeoisie. In 1781 Mozart had called Vienna "the land of the clavier," and in the earlier 19th century convivial music making around keyboard instrument was a ubiquitous entertainment. There was a great deal of amateur part singing, informal chamber-music groups abounded. Among all classes dancing was a veritable rage. It was reported that on one evening in carnival time in 1821 there were sicteen hundred balls in private homes in Vienna. An indigenous dance, the walts, gradually became the favorite, replacing the more stylized, aristrocratic, and foreign minuet and polonaise.

The son of a schoolmaster in the suburb of Liechtenthal, Schubert received excellent general and musical training first at his father's school, and from 1808 at the Vienna Stadtokonvijt. In 1813, at 16, he left Kovikt and the choir, entered a course in teacher's training, and taught as assistant to his father. All his spare time were spent at music, and at 1817 he gave up teaching to devote himself entirely to composition. A portion of his music, mostrly songs and short piano pieces, was published during his lifetime, but the bulk of it, particularly his large-scale compositions, remained unknown until after mid-century.

In his 31 years Schubert produced a very sizable corpus of works in traditional categories: included are 8 operas and Singspiele, 7 Masses, 8 symphonies, 12 string quartets, and 15 piano sonatas. In he early work for orchestra (1813-18), he plunged back into Vienna's past, Haydn and Mozart, for his most general stylistic models.

> The last movement of the C-minor Symphony, for example, Schubert write a "perpetual motion" piece with almost continuous movement in eighth notes. Against this he repeats regular, dancelike, almost trivial melodies; waht is captivating here are the kaleidoscopic shifts in harmony and instrumentation. Such innocent an leisurely repetition of material is a hallmark of Schubert's music.

From early childhood the young musician took the viola or violin part in music making ant home and at the Stadtkinvikt.

> Trout Quintet, fourth movement and in the Death and the Maiden Quartet show how strikingly Schubert's notion of theme-and-variations differed from Betthoven's. In the DIabelli Variations, and the variations of the Quartet Op. 131 Beethoven indulges in radical thematic transformation and audacious novelties of figuration and rhythm. Schubert's variations are by comparison formally conventional. Their charm lies elsewhere: in ever-fresh rhythms and inexhaustible melodic inventiveness.

Any mention of his own efforts at large-scale instrumental compositions invariable invoked the spectre of Beethoven.

## Music for Piano: Clementi, Dusík, and Field

The musicla instrument that Schubert and most other 19 century composerts played best was the piano. It was and is the only instrument regularly heard in a solo capacity in public. As pianos are large and complicated machines, the great urban centers had something of a monopoly in their cultivation and use. London, Vienna, and Paris.

In the rich concert life of London the piano was well known since J. C. Bach began to play public solos on small English square puano-fortes in the late 1760s. In 1780s and 1790s a succession of young pianists was heard on the London stage: Muzio Clementi, J. L. Dusík (1760-1812), J. B. Cramer (1771-1858), John Field (1782-1837), and Ignaz Moscheles (1794-1870). Others appeared for breif engagements: J. N. Hummel, Daniel Steibelt, Friedrich Kalkbrenner (1785-1849), and the boy Franz Liszt (1811-86), who made his london debut in 1824. In the itineraries of the more peripatetic of these musicians we can detect the beginings of that familiar 19th century phenomenon, the touring virtuoso.

### Clementi

Until the mid-19th centiry, public pianinsts for the most part played their own music; in this branch of music making the traditional identity of composer and performer lingered on. Peices were performed by the composer on stage and the promptly offered for sale (often in simplified versions) to a receptive public. Perhaps the earliest pianist-composer to practive this diversified profession on an international scale was the cosmopolitan Clementi, born in Rome, but lived in London from about 1774. Clementi's music, first published in London, Paris, and Vienna, was quickly pirated by a host of unauthorized printers (this was an accepted 18th centiry practice) and disseminated throught Europe. His powerful tight-knit sonatas of the 1780s and 1790s influenced Beethoven from about the turn of the century.

As early as his Opus 2 of 1779 he wrote melodic lines lavishly decorated with altered tones astonishingly like those of Parisian piano style two generations later. And some twenty years afterwards he composed music that seems comfortable at home in the new century. Clementi characteristically indulges in lucuriant melodic ornament, strong chormaticism, far-flung tonal relashionships, and long stretches of melliflous passage work. These are all familiar traits of Romantic piano music. Clementi's career prefigured that of many 19th century pianist-composers ina nother way as weel. From the late 1790s he became increasingly involved in the "music business": in manufacture and sale of pianos and in music publishing and editing. From 1798 until 1830 Clementi and Co. was one o fthe world's major vendors of these necessiteis of musical life.

### Dusík

Jan Ladislav Dusík was born in Behomia and practiced his craft as pianist and composer in Germany, Holland, and France before coming to London (as a refugee from the French Revolution) in 1789 until 1810, when the collapse of his business ventures forced his departure. Moving restlessly during the Napoleonic years from Hamburg to the service of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (himself an ambitious composer), and then to Paris as music director to Prince Talleyrand, Dusík gained wide international recognition as a virtuoso pianist and composer. His style matured in the decade spent in London. Like his older colleague Clementi, he devoted gis most serious and fuitful efforts to his solo piano sonatas, some 32 in all.

A characteristic late sonata of Dusík's is his Opus 61 (C 211) in F# minor. Several enduring trairs of romantic keyboard styles may be seen here. A weakening of the traditional tonic-dominnat axis of sonata-tyoe movements results from the introduction of foreign tonalities that function as ornamental neighboring keys to the principal ones. But perhaps even more innovative are the substantial stretches of genuinely indeterminate tonality effected by ubiquitous diminished seventh chords and chromatic shifts. Fast figurations for both hands requiring large leaps and intricate changes of direction, and even faster multi-octave arpeggios and scales reflect the predilections of a new breed of "public" pianist.

### John Field

A younger piano composer within the London orbit was Johan Baptist Cramer. About 1788 he madehis debut both as a composer and as a concert performer. His keyboard etudes were praised by Beethoven, and they alone of all his music are still used for study today.

Of more intrinsic and historical interest is the piani music of John Field, native of Dublin who came to London in 1793, became under the tutelage if Clementi a recognized virtuoso at an early age, and accompanied his teacher to Russia in 1803, there to remain for most of his life. Pictued in contemporary accounts as an awkward, tractable young man—and later as a dissolute alcoholic—Field was nonetheless and almost legendary performer whose style of writing and playing for the paino exerted a decisive effect upon the virtuosos of the next generation: Chopin, Liszt, Thalberg, and others. In comparison with his London contempoaries he had a dramatic reduction in sonata and sonatalike pieces. Only 4 solo keyboard sonatas, 3 of them published in 1801 and dedicated to Clementi. 

> The bulk of Field's keyboard music consists of shorter pieces adorned with all sorts of names: there are familiar-soundinng rondos, variations, polonaises, and etudesl more avantgarde are the designations "walts", "romance", and "pastorale". One type became Field's special province: his fifteen nocturnes for piano wer apparently the first such pieces. and served as a model for Chopin and other Romantic keyboard composers. Field's nocturnes characteristically present a lyrical, sometimes lavishly ornamented molody for the right hand supported by a wide-ranging arpeggiated accompaniment. Most often the harmonic motion is slow, as individual sonorities are sustained through extensive tonic pedal points. This allows for special "atmospheric" effects by lavish use of pedal—it was this trait of Field's music, in fact, that Robert Schumann singled out in 1835 as the Irishman's signal contribution to Romantic musical style.

When pianists appeared in public concerts from the time of Mozart until the middle of the 19th century, piano concertos we mosy often played. Publishing concertos was always an expensive and risky business. Difficult music with orchestral acoompaniment was never in much demand in amateur circles. As a result, a great many concertos by leading pianists from this period have been lost—or, as in the case of works by both Clementi and Dusík, preserverd only in more salable arrangements as sonatas.

All seven of Field's known concertos were published in full score during his lifetime. These compositions illustrate certain chraccteristic tendencies in the Romantic piano concerto: the exquisite balance of forces that is the glory of Mozart's and Beethove's concertos is tipped in favor of the solo instrument, the orchestral writing is rather primitive, and the extended harmonic and tonal syntax we have seen in sonatas of the period is exploited. The the first movement of his Third Concerto might have come from a Field nocturne without the minimal orchestral accompaniment.

### Paris

Nearly all the leading pianists of Beethoven's generation (not including Beethoven himself) performed at one time or another in Paris, and all had their music published there. But few were born in France, or were educated there during the tumultuos Napoleonic years or the uncertain Restoration (1815-30), or lived there for any length of time.

Only Friederich Kalkbrenner and Henri Herz (1803-88) achieved international standing, and neither was originally French. In general, Paris during the Beethoveinian years was more a consumer than a producer of pianists and piano music.

Beethoven's own city of Vienna surely produced more distinguished pianist-composers during the early decades of the 19th century than any other. Most were born elsewhere, a remarkable number of them in nearby Bohemia.

## Czerny, Moscheles, Hummel

Beethoven's faithful pupil and frind Carl Czenze (1791-1857) was born of Bohemian parentage in Vienna and sent virtually his entire life there. Most valued among pianists for his prodigious output of keyboard exercises, Czerny is always seen as the archetypal pedagogue rather than a creator, despite compiling some 1000 musical opera, nearly all of them for piano.

More cosmopolitan, and influential as a composer, was the Bohemian-born pianist Ignaz Moscheles who was instructed by Albrechtsberger and Salieri in Vienna, and befriended by Beethoven. In 1821 he took residence in London. Collaborated with his former student Menndelssohn and with Schumann in the founding of the Leipzig Conservatory. Moscheles efforts reflect a continuing adherence to the manner of middle-period Beethoven. Moscheles to some extent shared the fate of Craner abd Czerby. Mosy of his compositions, boyth the frankly a la mode ones and those that wer emore serioursly motivated, passed quickly out of fashion; his piano etudes alone enjoyed a longer currency.

Moscheles' older collegue Johan Nepomuk Hummel, was even more cosmopolitan and veriagated. Boen in Pressburh (now Bratislava), but came to Vienna to study with Mozart, Haydn, Albrechtsberger and Salieri. Hummel as a child charmed audiences in Vienna with his elegant, fluent style of playing, and did the same in London as early as 1791. While maintaining a long-term employment at the court of Stuttgart and Weimar, he produced an unceasing stream of compositions: church music, operas, chamer music, and a great mass of piano music. Like many piano composers of his time, Hummel wrote a proportionately small number of solo sonatas—there are nine—but invested them with his best efforts.

> The piece is a good illustration of the ever-present contradictions in style an dintent among public musicians of this time: popular success and serious artistic attainment often prove immiscible. But in this instance posterity judged well; Hummel's F# minor sonata is a worthy work, and one of the few of his compositions that remained in the repertories of succeding generations.

Václav Jan Tomásek (1774-1850) was described by his famous student Eduard Hanslick as the "musicla Dalailama" of Prague. What attracted most attention, in his time and ours, are his numerous smaller piano pices with the intriguing names "eclogue", "dithyramb" and "rhapsody". On the strengh of these compositions (or perhaps of their names), Tomásek has often been pointed to as a founder of the Romantic "character piece"—a composition with its own special personality and expression, as opposed to one that is merely representative of a genre.

The named he chose are all poetic terms from classical antiquity. An eclogue is a pastoral poem, a dithyramb a kind of poetry in praise of Bacchus; rhapsody was the name for a selection for recitation from epic poetry—this last being the only one of these titles adopted by later Romantic composers.

## Schubert's Piano Music

> If any single external factor distinguishes Schubert from all the other pianists mentioned here, it is that he was not a public virtuoso, and the kind and quality of his keyboard music reflect this crucial distinction.

His keyboard compositions fall roughly into two categories: modest pieces appropiate for domestic amateur performance and large-scale compositions in severlal movements, in which Schubert patiently explored the most profound and intricate possibilities of his art.

> In the piano sonata 960 in B-flat, Schubert develops to the full his unique gifts for melodic invention, captivating piano sound and figuration, and striking key relationships. And in all four movements can be heard, once again, Schubert's habitual evocation of the dance. But However clearly this music displays the composer's personal stamp, it is nonetheless a sonata, and for Schubert that category had special implications: it carried with it the inviolable compositional traditions of Haydn, Mozart, and especially Beethoven. In both outer movements Schubert is at pains to engage in determined developmental procedures that are not really native to his style, but which in this case succeed brilliantly.

The harmonic similarity to the opening theme (also dancelike) of the finale of Beethoven's Strign Quartet Op. 130 in the same key, ocompleted just before his final illness and death, in unmistakable. Thus in his last major composition Schubert acknowledged the sort of debt to his older contemporary that was to prove a burden to nearly every composer of instrument music of the 19th century. Bu he did so in a composition that fully establishes his own greatness in the very traditions to which Beethoven seemed to have gained proprietary claim.
