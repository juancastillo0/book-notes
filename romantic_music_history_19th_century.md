## Music, Patronage, and the Public

Before, the arts was based on a patronage system. Renaissance in Italy took place under the Church and the ducal courts. Botticelli and Michelangelo were employed by the Medici family, dukes of Florence.

Engravings and printing in the 15th century gave access to a broader clientele.

> Music, perhaps more than any other art, had always been associated with direct patronage. [...] In court and Church, European musicians from Machaut to Monteverdi to J.S. Bach necessarily found their place.

The first musical entertainment that began to separate from the patronage was opera. The first house was opened in 1637, Venice. It was now possible for ordinary citizens to buy tickets to a staged performance. By the end of the 17th century, 9 opera houses were opened in Venice. In the late 17th century, Naples, Paris and Hamburg opened opera houses. It became the most popular musical entertainments in Europe.

By the 18th century, concerts came. In Italy they were mainly organized by the academies. By the end of the century, they invited audiences and became concert organizations. "Until well into the 19th century the ordinary word for 'concert' in Italy (and even Vienna) was 'academia'." 

In German-speaking countries, concerts came from more plebian surroundings. From organizations for amateur music making, "collegia musica". The quality improved, as more professional musicians were being hired. In Leipzig 1730s, J.S. Bach was the director. G.P. Teleman was the director for the organizations in Frankfurt and Hamburg. It became increasingly plain that the music was not in service of the Church and court, but in "capturing the interest of emergent educated, largely middle-class public."

England with its strong commerce and prosperous middle-class had musical performances being arranged in homes as early as 1672. By the end of the 18th century, one could find concerts each night at the height of the season (January-May).

French concerts came into being largely as a substitute for opera. The Concerts Spirituels, most prestigious of all Parisian concert organizations, were founded by the distinguished musician and chess player A.D. Philidor in 1725. Thought the century there were many other organizations.

### Public

In the later 18th century the word "public", in its modern meaning, took form.

> The very expression "public opinion" appeared in several languages at this time.

### Instruments

As increasing number of people had the means and leisure to indulge in arts, there was a dramatic increase in music making at home.

> The guitar enjoyed and enormous vogue all over Europe shortly after the mid of the century. But keyboard instruments exceeded all others in popularity, their great range and adaptability to all kinds of musical textures, thick or thin, contrapuntal or homophonic. In the second half od the 18th century as the pianoforte supplanted the older harpsichord and clavichord, additional dimensions of expressiveness in the new instrument made it irresistible to amateur players.

There were two pianos in the 18th century, "Viennese" (light, rapid action with a "nasal" sound) and "English". 

Mozart praised the Viennese pianos handsomely in 1777 Augsburg in the workshop of Johann Stein. During the following decades, Vienna became the center of a burgeoning industry in the construction of pianos after Stein's model.

Piano manufacturing in England began after the immigration of German instrument makers from Saxony during the Seven Years War (1756-63). In 1781 a scotsman, John Broadwood joined Tschudi's workshop, one of the immigrants. 

> The English piano (whose mechanism was originally from Italy by way of Germany) produced a sound more powerful and sonorous but less bright than that of the Viennese instrument. This design became the basis for the percussive and velvety sound of the 19th century pianoforte.

### Music Printing

Another business that benefitted from an enlarged literate public was music printing. About 1765 the Leipzig printer Immanuel Breitkopf invented a new typesetting method that made it possible to publish keyboard music and simple songs at volume and at a substantially lower price. In the late 18th century, easy piano pieces with voice, flute or violin, or piano alone, constituted the bulk of the offering for major publishers in Paris, Vienna, Leipzig and London. The publication of "professional music", such as full orchestras, was rare until the second quarter of the 19th century. At the end of the 18th century, these publishing houses started to address the public with musical periodicals (journals), most of them for the new musical public.

### Musicians Work and Patronage

For musicians, now it became possible to make a living by offering their services as free agents. Again, this happened earlier in England than elsewhere. The shift was also visible in the most famous composers of the period. Mozart's quarrels with his employer, the Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg, ended with the composer's resignation in 1781. The remaining 10 years of his life wew spent in free-lance composing, performing, and teaching in Vienna. Beethoven, though dependent upon commissions and stipends from the aristocracy, was never in the direct employment after he left the court at Vonn for Vienna in 1792. Haydn lived in both worlds, he continues as kapellmeister for Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy and in the 1790s, he embraces his life as a public musician as he conducted his symphonies at concerts in London.

There were precious few courts and Churches left in Europe with the means or prestige to maintain elaborate musical establishments or to attract important composers. There were exceptions, such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) at the Weimar court, Louis Spohr in Kassel, Liszt (1811-1886) spent many of his later years at the Weimar court, and Wagner was able to extract financial support fromm the King Ludwig II of Bavaria. **Genuine success meant public success.**

## The Composer's Training

Most composers in the 17th and early 18th century were taught inside their families for the Church or courts. Fathers would often pass the skills and positions within their family. One must ofter distinguish between 2 or more composers of the same name, Gabrielis of Venice, Scarlattis of Naples and Rome, Coupoerins and Philidors in France and Bachs in Thuringia and Saxony. Even Beethoven and Mozart learned at a young age in their family. 

With the disappearance of the patronage system, Most composers in the 19th century learned their craft later in life and by a different route. Schubert's and Chopin's fathers where schoolmasters. Schumann was the son of a bookseller. Berlioz's father was a doctor. Dvorak's family were innkeepers. Wagner's parents' profession is not clear, but they were not musicians. One exception to this rule is Felix Mendelssohn, which received training from his mother.

The typical 19th century composer has much less musical training early in life. "And therein lies one explanation for the dissipation of a 'central style' in th 19th century, and for the extraordinary diversity of Romantic music."

## Musical Aesthetics

> Philosophers of the time, such as Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer, set themselves to define the principles, goals, and significance of the arts as a cohesive community.

> For writers of the time aesthetics was a very serious business because art suddenly seemed more important than ever before.

After the undermining of the religious establishment in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Enlightenment provided a temporary refuge. The revolution and war between 1780 adn 1815, left the intellectual community in disarray and disillusionment. Others turned again to religion. 

> For others, specially in Germany, art took on the status of a kind of secular religion; it was widely thought to provide access to a level of reality that transcended the accidents and restrictions of a person's ordinary existence.

Shelley wrote:

> I am the eye with which the Universe\
> Beholds itself and knows itself divine;\
> All harmony of instrument or verse,\
> All prophecy, all medicine is mine,\
> All light of art or nature;—to my song\
> Victory and praise in its own right belong.

According to Schopenhauer, we can access the Will, the pattern or mold thought to underline all phenomena we experience, thought art, and music even circumvents that step. Since, it is the "immediate representation of the Will". Music offers us a glimpse to the most fundamental nature of the universe, unknowable in any other way.

It is unlikely that these ideas were heard by musicians. Yet Schuman was an avid reader and admirer of Hoffmann. Ideas similar to these were heard from 1810 onward, particularly in Germany.

> It was art that held me back. Ah it seemed to me impossible to leave the world until a had brought forth all that I felt was within me.
> 
> \- Beethoven

The Promethean of composers, as a firebringer from the gods to man gained wide currency among musicians and music critics earlier in the 19th century. Also contributed to the widening of the serious and popular music (art vs entertainment).

> For whom was he writing his works? For himself and a select company of connoisseurs, or perhaps for the enlightened posterity? Or perhaps for the anonymous public whose approval could bring popularity and a living wage?

Weber, Berlioz, Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner show signs of this struggle. One sign is the extraordinary volume of apologetic, didactic and downright propagandistic prose written by composers of the time.


## Historicism in Music

Historicism, the reassessment of historic events, in particular the Middle Ages, formerly despised, was subject to appreciative reinterpretations. There was a new admiration for Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes who stood outside the classical tradition canonized by French academic standards.

Works of art that depend on recreation though performance tend to have a short life expectancy. Music is more fragile than paintings or sculpture. In the late Middle Ages, music style tended to change from one generation to the next. Only a few manuscripts were preserved. Europeans seldom listened to music from previous generations. In the 18th century, Bach, Handel, Haydn were expected to deliver continuous successions of new work.

In the early 19th century, as the effect of Historicism was felt in music, concerts of older music started to be played. 

### Bach's revival and influence

The most spectacular of these recoveries, and more far reaching in its implications for music in the Romantic era, was the "Bach revival". He was largely unknown outside of Germany, until de publication of The Well-Tempered Clavier in 1800, with many others key works resurrected in the following decades.

The compositions if the 19th century were not only in competition with their contemporaries. 

> Schubert, Schumann and Brahms expressed discouragement at the prospect of writing quartets and symphonies after Beethoven. To a lesser extent for organ music after Bach and oratorios after Handel. The traditional categories of instrumental music were not extensively cultivated. Symphonies, sonatas, and concertos were to a considerable extent displaced by a proliferation of smaller types of indeterminate lineage: music related to the dance, fantasies, ballades, intermezzos, and the like.

Beethoven, Schuman and Brahms were strongly indebted to Bach's model for the formation and nurturing of they style. Composers of the 19th century tended to see Bach as an isolated genius.

> In respect to compositions in organ and piano, no one in his century can compare with him. To me, everything appears in comparison to the development of this giant figure as something conceived in childhood.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

> Mozart and Hayden had a partial one-sided knowledge of Bach. [...] The profound powers of combination,the poetry and humor of recent music have their origin largely in Bach. Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, all the so-called romantics (I mean Germans, of course) are in their music much closer to Bach than Mozart was.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

Romantic music's nourishment by older music—particularly Baroque compositional practice—was health and indispensable.

> The collective musical memory of forty years described by Tinctoris [in the late Middle Ages] was double and tripled and quadrupled as the 19th century advanced. A heightened consciousness of history informed and in some ways transformed the musical culture of the entire era.

## "Romantic"

In music criticism the word "romanic" has been used in the beginning of the 19th century, were it meant "abstract" or "indefinite" or "imaginative"— or simply modern as opposed to "ancient". 

> A preference to the original rather than the normative, a pursuit of unique effects and extremes of expressiveness, the mobilization to that end of an enriched harmonic vocabulary, striking new figurations, textures and tone colors.

"Romantic" is often paired with its supposed opposite, "classic". In 1836, the influential Leipzig music critic Amadeus Wendt distinguished a classic period consisting almost exclusively of the works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But it is probably a mistake to think of the classical period in opposition to the romantic. Characteristics of "classic" music—an implied metric regularity, a circumscribed diatonic harmonic syntax, a largely homophonic texture, and slow harmonic rhythm—persist in large sectors of musical practice in th 19th century. And characteristic we think as "romantic" are found in the 18th century, C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Clementi.

Although there is no clear separation, here we shall begin from the compositions of the maturing Beethoven in Vienna after his move in 1792. Romantic musicians with near unanimity claimed him as their own. However tortuous the course of his later style, they remained rooted in Viennese Classicism.
