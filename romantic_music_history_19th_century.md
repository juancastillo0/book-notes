Nobility was superseded by commerce.
England, France and Netherlands.

The democratic thought of the late 18th century had much impact in the 19th century. Napoleon.
David Hume, Pain... Critics of the Christian institution.

## Music, Patronage, and the Public

Before, the arts was based on a patronage system. Renaissance in Italy took place under the Church and the ducal courts. Botticelli and Michelangelo were employed by the Medici family, dukes of Florence.

Engravings and printing in the 15th century gave access to a broader clientele.

> Music, perhaps more than any other art, had always been associated with direct patronage. [...] In court and Church, European musicians from Machaut to Monteverdi to J.S. Bach necessarily found their place.

The first musical entertainment that began to separate from the patronage was opera. The first house was opened in 1637, Venice. It was now possible for ordinary citizens to buy tickets to a staged performance. By the end of the 17th century, 9 opera houses were opened in Venice. In the late 17th century, Naples, Paris and Hamburg opened opera houses. It became the most popular musical entertainments in Europe.

By the 18th century, concerts came. In Italy they were mainly organized by the academies. By the end of the century, they invited audiences and became concert organizations. "Until well into the 19th century the ordinary word for 'concert' in Italy (and even Vienna) was 'academia'." 

In German-speaking countries, concerts came from more plebian surroundings. From organizations for amateur music making, "collegia musica". The quality improved, as more professional musicians were being hired. In Leipzig 1730s, J.S. Bach was the director. G.P. Teleman was the director for the organizations in Frankfurt and Hamburg. It became increasingly plain that the music was not in service of the Church and court, but in "capturing the interest of emergent educated, largely middle-class public."

England with its strong commerce and prosperous middle-class had musical performances being arranged in homes as early as 1672. By the end of the 18th century, one could find concerts each night at the height of the season (January-May).

French concerts came into being largely as a substitute for opera. The Concerts Spirituels, most prestigious of all Parisian concert organizations, were founded by the distinguished musician and chess player A.D. Philidor in 1725. Thought the century there were many other organizations.

### Public

In the later 18th century the word "public", in its modern meaning, took form.

> The very expression "public opinion" appeared in several languages at this time.

### Instruments

As increasing number of people had the means and leisure to indulge in arts, there was a dramatic increase in music making at home.

> The guitar enjoyed and enormous vogue all over Europe shortly after the mid of the century. But keyboard instruments exceeded all others in popularity, their great range and adaptability to all kinds of musical textures, thick or thin, contrapuntal or homophonic. In the second half od the 18th century as the pianoforte supplanted the older harpsichord and clavichord, additional dimensions of expressiveness in the new instrument made it irresistible to amateur players.

There were two pianos in the 18th century, "Viennese" (light, rapid action with a "nasal" sound) and "English". 

Mozart praised the Viennese pianos handsomely in 1777 Augsburg in the workshop of Johann Stein. During the following decades, Vienna became the center of a burgeoning industry in the construction of pianos after Stein's model.

Piano manufacturing in England began after the immigration of German instrument makers from Saxony during the Seven Years War (1756-63). In 1781 a scotsman, John Broadwood joined Tschudi's workshop, one of the immigrants. 

> The English piano (whose mechanism was originally from Italy by way of Germany) produced a sound more powerful and sonorous but less bright than that of the Viennese instrument. This design became the basis for the percussive and velvety sound of the 19th century pianoforte.

### Music Printing

Another business that benefitted from an enlarged literate public was music printing. About 1765 the Leipzig printer Immanuel Breitkopf invented a new typesetting method that made it possible to publish keyboard music and simple songs at volume and at a substantially lower price. In the late 18th century, easy piano pieces with voice, flute or violin, or piano alone, constituted the bulk of the offering for major publishers in Paris, Vienna, Leipzig and London. The publication of "professional music", such as full orchestras, was rare until the second quarter of the 19th century. At the end of the 18th century, these publishing houses started to address the public with musical periodicals (journals), most of them for the new musical public.

### Musicians Work and Patronage

For musicians, now it became possible to make a living by offering their services as free agents. Again, this happened earlier in England than elsewhere. The shift was also visible in the most famous composers of the period. Mozart's quarrels with his employer, the Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg, ended with the composer's resignation in 1781. The remaining 10 years of his life wew spent in free-lance composing, performing, and teaching in Vienna. Beethoven, though dependent upon commissions and stipends from the aristocracy, was never in the direct employment after he left the court at Vonn for Vienna in 1792. Haydn lived in both worlds, he continues as kapellmeister for Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy and in the 1790s, he embraces his life as a public musician as he conducted his symphonies at concerts in London.

There were precious few courts and Churches left in Europe with the means or prestige to maintain elaborate musical establishments or to attract important composers. There were exceptions, such as Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) at the Weimar court, Louis Spohr in Kassel, Liszt (1811-1886) spent many of his later years at the Weimar court, and Wagner was able to extract financial support fromm the King Ludwig II of Bavaria. **Genuine success meant public success.**

## The Composer's Training

Most composers in the 17th and early 18th century were taught inside their families for the Church or courts. Fathers would often pass the skills and positions within their family. One must ofter distinguish between 2 or more composers of the same name, Gabrielis of Venice, Scarlattis of Naples and Rome, Coupoerins and Philidors in France and Bachs in Thuringia and Saxony. Even Beethoven and Mozart learned at a young age in their family. 

With the disappearance of the patronage system, Most composers in the 19th century learned their craft later in life and by a different route. Schubert's and Chopin's fathers where schoolmasters. Schumann was the son of a bookseller. Berlioz's father was a doctor. Dvorak's family were innkeepers. Wagner's parents' profession is not clear, but they were not musicians. One exception to this rule is Felix Mendelssohn, which received training from his mother.

The typical 19th century composer has much less musical training early in life. "And therein lies one explanation for the dissipation of a 'central style' in th 19th century, and for the extraordinary diversity of Romantic music."

## Musical Aesthetics

> Philosophers of the time, such as Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer, set themselves to define the principles, goals, and significance of the arts as a cohesive community.

> For writers of the time aesthetics was a very serious business because art suddenly seemed more important than ever before.

After the undermining of the religious establishment in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Enlightenment provided a temporary refuge. The revolution and war between 1780 adn 1815, left the intellectual community in disarray and disillusionment. Others turned again to religion. 

> For others, specially in Germany, art took on the status of a kind of secular religion; it was widely thought to provide access to a level of reality that transcended the accidents and restrictions of a person's ordinary existence.

Shelley wrote:

> I am the eye with which the Universe\
> Beholds itself and knows itself divine;\
> All harmony of instrument or verse,\
> All prophecy, all medicine is mine,\
> All light of art or nature;—to my song\
> Victory and praise in its own right belong.

According to Schopenhauer, we can access the Will, the pattern or mold thought to underline all phenomena we experience, thought art, and music even circumvents that step. Since, it is the "immediate representation of the Will". Music offers us a glimpse to the most fundamental nature of the universe, unknowable in any other way.

It is unlikely that these ideas were heard by musicians. Yet Schuman was an avid reader and admirer of Hoffmann. Ideas similar to these were heard from 1810 onward, particularly in Germany.

> It was art that held me back. Ah it seemed to me impossible to leave the world until a had brought forth all that I felt was within me.
> 
> \- Beethoven

The Promethean of composers, as a firebringer from the gods to man gained wide currency among musicians and music critics earlier in the 19th century. Also contributed to the widening of the serious and popular music (art vs entertainment).

> For whom was he writing his works? For himself and a select company of connoisseurs, or perhaps for the enlightened posterity? Or perhaps for the anonymous public whose approval could bring popularity and a living wage?

Weber, Berlioz, Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner show signs of this struggle. One sign is the extraordinary volume of apologetic, didactic and downright propagandistic prose written by composers of the time.


## Historicism in Music

Historicism, the reassessment of historic events, in particular the Middle Ages, formerly despised, was subject to appreciative reinterpretations. There was a new admiration for Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes who stood outside the classical tradition canonized by French academic standards.

Works of art that depend on recreation though performance tend to have a short life expectancy. Music is more fragile than paintings or sculpture. In the late Middle Ages, music style tended to change from one generation to the next. Only a few manuscripts were preserved. Europeans seldom listened to music from previous generations. In the 18th century, Bach, Handel, Haydn were expected to deliver continuous successions of new work.

In the early 19th century, as the effect of Historicism was felt in music, concerts of older music started to be played. 

### Bach's revival and influence

The most spectacular of these recoveries, and more far reaching in its implications for music in the Romantic era, was the "Bach revival". He was largely unknown outside of Germany, until de publication of The Well-Tempered Clavier in 1800, with many others key works resurrected in the following decades.

The compositions if the 19th century were not only in competition with their contemporaries. 

> Schubert, Schumann and Brahms expressed discouragement at the prospect of writing quartets and symphonies after Beethoven. To a lesser extent for organ music after Bach and oratorios after Handel. The traditional categories of instrumental music were not extensively cultivated. Symphonies, sonatas, and concertos were to a considerable extent displaced by a proliferation of smaller types of indeterminate lineage: music related to the dance, fantasies, ballades, intermezzos, and the like.

Beethoven, Schuman and Brahms were strongly indebted to Bach's model for the formation and nurturing of they style. Composers of the 19th century tended to see Bach as an isolated genius.

> In respect to compositions in organ and piano, no one in his century can compare with him. To me, everything appears in comparison to the development of this giant figure as something conceived in childhood.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

> Mozart and Hayden had a partial one-sided knowledge of Bach. [...] The profound powers of combination,the poetry and humor of recent music have their origin largely in Bach. Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, all the so-called romantics (I mean Germans, of course) are in their music much closer to Bach than Mozart was.
> 
> \- Robert Schumann

Romantic music's nourishment by older music—particularly Baroque compositional practice—was health and indispensable.

> The collective musical memory of forty years described by Tinctoris [in the late Middle Ages] was double and tripled and quadrupled as the 19th century advanced. A heightened consciousness of history informed and in some ways transformed the musical culture of the entire era.

## "Romantic"

In music criticism the word "romanic" has been used in the beginning of the 19th century, were it meant "abstract" or "indefinite" or "imaginative"— or simply modern as opposed to "ancient". 

> A preference to the original rather than the normative, a pursuit of unique effects and extremes of expressiveness, the mobilization to that end of an enriched harmonic vocabulary, striking new figurations, textures and tone colors.

"Romantic" is often paired with its supposed opposite, "classic". In 1836, the influential Leipzig music critic Amadeus Wendt distinguished a classic period consisting almost exclusively of the works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But it is probably a mistake to think of the classical period in opposition to the romantic. Characteristics of "classic" music—an implied metric regularity, a circumscribed diatonic harmonic syntax, a largely homophonic texture, and slow harmonic rhythm—persist in large sectors of musical practice in th 19th century. And characteristic we think as "romantic" are found in the 18th century, C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Clementi.

Although there is no clear separation, here we shall begin from the compositions of the maturing Beethoven in Vienna after his move in 1792. Romantic musicians with near unanimity claimed him as their own.

However tortuous the course of his later style, Beethoven remained rooted in Viennese Classicism.

# Chapter 2: Beethoven in Vienna, 1792-1808

Beethoven, 22 years when he arrived to Vienna from Bonn, might seem to have no special advantages. He made some effort to acquire social graces, but his behavior was at times uncouth, and over the years became increasingly eccentric. However, Beethoven came recommended from Elector-Archbishop Maximilian Franz of Cologne, uncle of the current emperor, Leopold II, and Count Waldstein from Bonn.

Beethoven studied with Haydn for one year (1792). Haydn was, apparently, not very conscientious about the lessons. Relations remained distant until Haydn's death in 1809.

Beethoven had two other teachers during his early years in Vienna: Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, with whom he continued his study of counterpoint, and Antonio Salieri, who coached him in Italian declamation.

In 1795 he began to appear in public concerts. He had marvelous ability to improvise and engaged in multiple contests with pianists such as Clementi, Gelinek, Wolfl, Steibelt.

The first houses in which he lived in Vienna was that of Prince Lichnowsky, who became his foremost patron.

## Early Stylistics Growth: Piano Sonatas

Beethoven's musical imagination was tied to the newest keyboard instrument, the piano.

Piano sonatas of Opus 2, finished in 1795, show a departure from the norms of Classical style. An adaptation of the Piano Quartet, an example of a "Accompanied keyboard sonata", one of the most common musical genres of the late 18th century. Rhe style was also changed from a regular melodic structure.

In *Pathétique Sonata*, Opus 13 changes the left-hand accompaniment broken-octave or *murky* bass.

Pianos sonatas before Beethoven had typically three movements (fast-slow-fast), or after the Italian manner, of only two (usually fast-faster). In Sonata Op. 26 (1800-01) he began with an Andante theme and variations, and substituting a lugubrious funeral march for the usual slow movement. Beethoven in 1800 "I am not very well satisfied with the work I have done thus far. I shall take a new way." In the 1790s the maturity accelerated noticeably. The central body of his compositions was centered around the piano, however, it began to relinquish its grip on his musical imagination.

A-major Quartet of Beethoven's Opus 18 was modeled after Mozart's Quartet in A-major, K. 464. The sixth quartet of Opus 18, differs from the others with an Adagio introduction to the Allegro finale (slow introductions to first movements were much more common). Long-held chords played alternatively *piano* and *forte* combine with extreme registral shifts. Adagio fragments are inserted into the Allegro, falling well outside the usual norms of Classic style.

## The Tempest Sonata, Op 31 No 2

Czerny mentioned these compositions as representative of Beethoven's "new way". Of the various sonatas, only *Pathétique* (Op. 13) and *Levewohl* (Op 81a) were named by Beethoven. Op 31's *Tempest* comes from Shakespeare's Tempest. Beginning feels improvisatory, however the music is used throughout the movement. Op 31 No 2, in which the melody is divided between lower and upper registers with a rapid oscillating accompaniment in the middle is quite unlike standard Viennese piano writing of the time. In multiple works, certain stylistic decisions can be traced back to Muzio Clementi.

31 years old in Vienna 1802, Beethoven entered a productive period. Beethoven took long daily walks with a pocket-sized sketchbook. 

## The Eroica Symphony

Probably the longest symphony ever written at that point and the first, in that period of 6 years, that inspired and intimidated Beethoven's followers in the 19th century and beyond.

"More unorthodox than its harmonic scheme is the number and nature of melodic motives in this exposition. [...] Another salient feature of this exposition a determined disruption of meter. Beginning in m. 25 harmonic and melodic interest are minimal, and the listener's attention is focused upon powerful accents falling regularly in patterns of two beats in contradiction to the 3/4 meter." Some 35 years later, the decidedly avant-garde composer and critic Hector Belioz (1803-69) found such procedures shocking.

The second movement, Marcia funebre (Funeral March) is modeled after the grand dirges played at the funeral for heroes of the revolution and Napoleonic wars. Such marches where composed in the 1970s by French composers of the day such as Francois Joseph Gossec (1734-1829), Étienne-Nicolas Méhul (1763-1817), and Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842). Very slow tempo, minor mode, imitations of drumrolls, and pervasive dotter rhythms characteristic od Republican funeral music. Beethoven was apparently fond of the melody and bass starting in m. 75: he had already used both as thematic material for his Piano Variations Op. 35 nad several early pieces. 

The "hero" Beethoven originally intended to celebrate in the Erotica was Napoleon. However, upon knowing that he had proclaimed himself emperor Beethoven removed the dedication, according to Ries and Schindler. In 1805 Napoleon's troops captured Vienna, this may be another reason for the change in dedication.

## Fidelio

Beethoven's only opera. Its libretto was provided by the Republican France. The opera adheres to the conventions of French opéra comique and German Singspiel. Prince Lichnowsky, Stephan von Breuning, the tenor Joseph August Rockel and others persuaded him to revise the opera en 1805. In 1808, the second revision was given and this time the critics were kinder. However, displeased with the performances and suspecting deliberate sabotage of his work by certain "enemies", he withdrew it from stage. With more revisions the opera was revived in 1814. This time text was provided by Georg Friedrich Treitschke and Beethoven conducting as at the first performance, it was a resounding success.

Beethoven never wrote another opera and Fidelio cost him enormous effort, it was clear that great victories were more easily achieved in other battlegrounds. This work stands as a monument to the composer's genius in the face of enormous odds. The primary obstacle in this case was the weaknesses  in the musical-dramatic structure of the opera.  For some the most valuable legacy was the instrumental music. 

> The Leonore Overtures Nos. 2 and 3, though judged even by Beethoven too overwhelming for an operatic introduction, hold a central place in the canon of his works from these splendid years of orchestral composition. In this area, his triumph was complete.

# Chapter 3: Beethoven: The Late Years, 1809-27

In May 1809 Napoleon's armies invaded Vienna, but unlike 1806, the invasion was resisted. The nobility left an, by May 12, the army entered Vienna. 

The French occupation and Beethoven's health affected his productivity in the following years. Colitis and local infections. His deafness, first evident in 1797, increase inexorable. He used "ear trumpets" and from 1816 he used conversation books.

His brother Gaspar Carl died in 1815 and he took guardianship of his son. He did not think his mother would be fit as a guardian.

Reclusiveness came to dominate Beethoven's life. In 1818 he wrote in his diary:

> Sacrifice once and for all the trivialities of social life to your art

The economy of the Hapsburg empire collapsed and Beethoven's sources of income were curtailed. In 1809, Archduke Rudolph, Princes Kinsky and Lobkowitz, concerned that he might leave the city, gave him a lifetime annuity of 4000 florins. However, the currency devaluated an 80%. In 1811 Lobkowitz ceased to pay and Kinsky died in 1812.

The year of the "second invasion" 1809 was still a productive year. In 1812 he finished both his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies. However, until 1823, he did not finished more than one major composition. Fifth in 1808 contains heaven-storming crescendos and echoes of French Revolutionary music, continues the "heroic" manner of the Third. Sixth (the *Pastoral*), is utterly different with programmatic titles for each movement ("The awakening of happy feelings upon arriving in the country", "Scene at the brook", "A jolly meeting of country folk", and the like). In 1812, the Seventh returns to the urgency and energy associated with Beethoven odd-numbered symphonies and the Eighth is an intentionally slighter work.

In the summer of 1812 Napoleon embarked on his disastrous Russian campaign. After a hasty regrouping, the French were beaten by Wellington at Vittoria in Spain on June 21 1813. It now seemed safe for the Hapsburg government to join the nations united against Napoleon.

Beethoven, along with Johann Nepomuk Malzel, wrote a "battle piece", called Wellington's Victory, to commemorate Napoleon's downfall. From the point of view of the Viennese public, always fickle and sometimes, as Beethoven and other complained, shallow in their judgement, The *Battle Symphony* was the composer's finest triumph. Beethoven gained certain benefits from the popularity: his Seventh Symphony was given repeated performances and and the way now stood clear for the 1814 revival of Fidelio.

---
The metronome was invented by F. N . Winkel and not by Malzel.

---

Like other composers of his time, such as Haydn, Clementi, Pleyel, and Kozuluch, Beethoven produced his share of "amateur music" intended for home performance and quick sale. Examples of this misuc are the arrangements of Scottish Airs and the Variations for piano with optional flute or violin, Opp. 105 and 107.


## Formation of the Late Style

In the early years, Beethoven had worked out his compositional problems at the piano. Now, in his mid-forties, chronically ipp, deaf, and engulfed in personal difficulties, he once showed signs of a major shift in style. Almost five years intervened between the *Lebewohl Sonata* Op. 81a, and the next piano sonata, Opus 90 in E minor, finished in 1814.

In the second of the two sonatas for Cello and Piano, Op. 102, an Allegro fugato whose first subject is clearly derivative of Baroque contrapuntual practice. The occur more usually in minor, as in J.S. Bach's *Musical Offering* of 1747. Mozart and Beethoven had written similar contrapuntual subjects as early as 1795.

Some of Beethoven's older contemporaries turned to musical styles of the Baroque for enrichment and sustenance. Haydn in 1770s, Clementi in 1780, and Mozart some 3 years later. Though well schooled in J.S. Bach's *Will-Tempered Clavier* in Bonn, his formal education in contrapuntual writing seems to have began with his move to Vienna in 1792. From about 1815 to the end of his life, fugal and contrapuntal procedures are tightly woven into the entire fabric of Beethoven's compositional practice.

## The Diabelli Variations

Another fascination in the late career are formal variations. Two of his last three piano sonatas, Op. 109 and Op. 110, end climatically with variations (the other, Op. 110, is fugal).

In 1819 the Viennese publisher Anotonio Diabelli invited leading composers to submit one variation on each waltz theme he had written. Beethoven at first refused. Early in 1819 he sketched several variations and and progressed throughout the years to 35 variations.

> When late in life Beethoven plunged headlong into the techniques of fugue and variation, hea was operation at both extremes of a stylistic spectrum. Fugue meant rigorous, strict style, associated often with church music and sometimes bearing connotations of dry academicism. Theme-and-variations, on the other hand, suggested amateur music—music for polite diversion and even for pleasing background noise. What these very unlikely types had in common is that they placed severe restrictions upon the composer.

> Whatever his continued alliance to the sonata, fugue, and theme-and-variations, Beethoven now bends their shapes to radically new ends. Boundaries between forms grows indistinct. Sonata-allegro and theme-and-variations types are elaborately mingled and fugues show the development of motives associated with sonata movements. And here, as nowhere else in the repertory, we feel the force of the Romantic notion of music as a "speech above verbal speech", as an expression of the inexpressible.

## The Missa Solemnis and Ninth Symphony

The two biggest compositions of Beethoven's last years (finished in 1823 and 1824).

In June 1819 is was announced that Archuke Rudolf was to be appointed Archbishop of the moravian city Olmutz, Beethoven wrote to him, "The day on which a High Mass composed by me will be performed during the ceremonies solemnized for your Imperial Highness will be the most glorious day of my life". In preparation for his task, Beethoven apparently buried himself in antiquarian studies. The Archduke's library provided examples of polyphonic Masses from the 16th century to his own time. He acquainted himself with the church modes of medieval plainsong and sought out traditional theoretical works on church music, such as the *Institutioni harmoniche* (1558) of Gioseffo Zarlino. When he began actual composition, titanic combat with this relatively unfamiliar genre ensued.

The fugue at the end of Gloria (mm. 440ff.) is a technical tour-de-force were the first 19 measures are set over a dominant pedal. Fugal and contrapuntal writing are ots ordinary language; imitative openings are standard for both chorus and soloists in all movements. 

The Ninth Symphony underwent a gestation period longer even than that of the *Missa solemnis*. It seemingly resulted from ideas for three different compositions, an entirely instrumental symphony, another one incorporating voices (10th symphony), and a setting of Schiller's poem.

> Be embrace, ye millions!\
> This kiss to the whole world!\
> Brothers—above the starry canopy\
> A Loving Father must dwell.

Such expansive sentiments of mingled humanism and religiosity might be expected to appeal to the composer.

> Let him who has ventured\
> To be friend of a friend,\
> Let him who has embrace a pretty girl\
> Add his joy to ours!

It was characteristic of Beethoven that he should be attracted to such homely expressions of humane impulses. Indeed the Freude theme itself seems intentionally "common." The ordinary generous sentiments of ordinary people, Beethoven seems to be saying in the finale of the Ninth, offer the best hope for mankind.

> In the view of musicians of the following generations, Beethoven seemed to be saying something else as well—that with this composition he had exhausted the expressive resources of the instrumental symphony, that he had burst its restraining boundaries by introducing text and voices.

> [...] the musical poem is urging toward a crisis, a crisis only to be voices in human speech. It is wonderful how the master makes the arrival of Man's voice and tongue a positive necessity, by this awe-inspiring recitative in the bass-strings.
> 
> \- Wagner

Such assessments were taken very seriously by later composers; Many such as Mendelsshon, Berlioz, and Mahler, followed his example in writing with vocal movements.

The use of soloists and chorus in a symphony was per se new and startling in 1824. However, the Ninth is reminiscent of Beethoven;s work of former years. The first movement and Scherzo extend the "heroic" tradition. And the finale shows echoes of the massive musical celebrations of the French revolution. Only the slow movement with its subtle alternation of two marvelous themes, seem to belong wholly to the composer's final period. Is is a supreme example of the composer's late "contemplative" style, and one of the finest melodies Beethoven ever wrote.

## The Late Quartets

In November 1822, Prince Nicholas Galitsin offered to commission "one, two, or three new quartets", and Beethoven deeply engrossed in the Missa solemnis ans Ninth Symphone, quickly accepted. Beethoven was already comtemplating a new quartet and from 1824 until his death, Beethoven devoted himself with rare single-mindedness to composing this most demanding and sophisticated of ensembles.

Only one of the three quartest for Galitsin was published during the composers lifetime. 

Early in December 1826 on a journey from his beother Johann's home in Gneixendorf back in Vienna, he fell seriously ill he subsequently underwent four operations and finally died, apparently from a collapse of liver function, on March 1827.

> The string quartet is thoroughly amenable to contrapuntal writing, and it provides an uncluttered medium for the exposition  of Beethoven's most advanced ideas in harmonic motion and thematic transformation.

Metrical and harmonic regularity is maintained to an astonishing degree nearly thought the movement. Having chosen to impose these strictures upon himself, Beethoven explores textures, extreme ranges, and kaleidoscopic instrumental combinations.

## Contemporary Assessment

Thoughout much of his adult life Beethoven was the most respected composer in Europe. His orchestral works quickly became standard fare at concerts everywhere except in France. At the funeral procession for this reclusive and misanthropic man the crowd in attendance was estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people.

Beginning with the first works of his maturity, shortly after 1800, Beethoven's music evoked from some qaurters a continuing litany of exasperated criticism. Too long, difficult, obscure, exxentric, and bizarre (or according to contemporary usage, "baroque"). In a private concert in Vienna of 1805 a reviewer wrote about Eroica:

> [...] It often loses itself in lawlessness... The reviewer belongs to Herr van Beethoven's sincerest admirers, but in this composition he must confess that he finds took much that is glaring and bizarre.

Beginning about 1804, a different straub of Betthoven criticism made an appearance. Anonymous authors make attempts to penetrate the aesthetic obscurities of Beethoven's music. In these reviews—most particularly in the introduction to that on the Fifth Symphony—Hoffmann provides a new approach to understanding Beethoven, as well as a central document in Romantic musical aesthetics.

As Beethoven grew older, his music divered even more markedly from his contemporaries. In 1824, a review of the Piano Sonata Op. 109 read:

> It cannot be denied that he withdraws increasingly within himself, and thus ever more absent himself even from the pursuits and interests of other music lovers. He reveals only his own subjective thoughts, and in his composing pays heed to nothing but his own inspiration.

A genuine masterpiece must be unique and at the same time exemplary. Beethoven's instrumental compositions were seen as both for the entire 19th century.

> In the view of many he held proprietary rights for vast areas of composition—the symphony, the sonata, the string quartet, and perhaps the piano concerto. And the man himself, a voluntary exile from society who seemed to follow inner lights of extraterrestrial origin, easily became a prototype for the Romantic artist, and the founder, by general consent, of Romantic music.


# Chapter 4: Beethoven's Contemporaries: Instrumental Music

Beethoven devoted enormous energies to traditional large-scale instrumental compositions in a time when this sort of music was passing out of fasion. Many of the symphones heard during the early 1800s were written in the previous century. The works of Haydn and Mozart predominated at first; only Beethoven's symphones rivaled theirs in international popularity. Others such as Clementi were performed in special occasions.

Orchestral music of Beethoven's contemporaries, even the yournger ones, was for the most part conservative.

The popularity of traditional types of chamber musci also suffered a precipitous decline in the new century. In the 1810s and 1820s there was still some enthusiasm in Paris for chamber mmusic for strings and winds.

## Schubert

The greatest composer among Beethoven's contemporaries was Franz Schubert (1797-1828). Vienna just after the Congress of 1814-15 was a place of celebration and easy gaiety. Countless coffe houses and inns were filled day and night with people who had time to relax, read, and talk. 

Amateur musical ensembles flourished among the bourgeoisie. In 1781 Mozart had called Vienna "the land of the clavier," and in the earlier 19th century convivial music making around keyboard instrument was a ubiquitous entertainment. There was a great deal of amateur part singing, informal chamber-music groups abounded. Among all classes dancing was a veritable rage. It was reported that on one evening in carnival time in 1821 there were sicteen hundred balls in private homes in Vienna. An indigenous dance, the walts, gradually became the favorite, replacing the more stylized, aristrocratic, and foreign minuet and polonaise.

The son of a schoolmaster in the suburb of Liechtenthal, Schubert received excellent general and musical training first at his father's school, and from 1808 at the Vienna Stadtokonvijt. In 1813, at 16, he left Kovikt and the choir, entered a course in teacher's training, and taught as assistant to his father. All his spare time were spent at music, and at 1817 he gave up teaching to devote himself entirely to composition. A portion of his music, mostrly songs and short piano pieces, was published during his lifetime, but the bulk of it, particularly his large-scale compositions, remained unknown until after mid-century.

In his 31 years Schubert produced a very sizable corpus of works in traditional categories: included are 8 operas and Singspiele, 7 Masses, 8 symphonies, 12 string quartets, and 15 piano sonatas. In he early work for orchestra (1813-18), he plunged back into Vienna's past, Haydn and Mozart, for his most general stylistic models.

> The last movement of the C-minor Symphony, for example, Schubert write a "perpetual motion" piece with almost continuous movement in eighth notes. Against this he repeats regular, dancelike, almost trivial melodies; waht is captivating here are the kaleidoscopic shifts in harmony and instrumentation. Such innocent an leisurely repetition of material is a hallmark of Schubert's music.

From early childhood the young musician took the viola or violin part in music making ant home and at the Stadtkinvikt.

> Trout Quintet, fourth movement and in the Death and the Maiden Quartet show how strikingly Schubert's notion of theme-and-variations differed from Betthoven's. In the DIabelli Variations, and the variations of the Quartet Op. 131 Beethoven indulges in radical thematic transformation and audacious novelties of figuration and rhythm. Schubert's variations are by comparison formally conventional. Their charm lies elsewhere: in ever-fresh rhythms and inexhaustible melodic inventiveness.

Any mention of his own efforts at large-scale instrumental compositions invariable invoked the spectre of Beethoven.

## Music for Piano: Clementi, Dusík, and Field

The musicla instrument that Schubert and most other 19 century composerts played best was the piano. It was and is the only instrument regularly heard in a solo capacity in public. As pianos are large and complicated machines, the great urban centers had something of a monopoly in their cultivation and use. London, Vienna, and Paris.

In the rich concert life of London the piano was well known since J. C. Bach began to play public solos on small English square puano-fortes in the late 1760s. In 1780s and 1790s a succession of young pianists was heard on the London stage: Muzio Clementi, J. L. Dusík (1760-1812), J. B. Cramer (1771-1858), John Field (1782-1837), and Ignaz Moscheles (1794-1870). Others appeared for breif engagements: J. N. Hummel, Daniel Steibelt, Friedrich Kalkbrenner (1785-1849), and the boy Franz Liszt (1811-86), who made his london debut in 1824. In the itineraries of the more peripatetic of these musicians we can detect the beginings of that familiar 19th century phenomenon, the touring virtuoso.

### Clementi

Until the mid-19th centiry, public pianinsts for the most part played their own music; in this branch of music making the traditional identity of composer and performer lingered on. Peices were performed by the composer on stage and the promptly offered for sale (often in simplified versions) to a receptive public. Perhaps the earliest pianist-composer to practive this diversified profession on an international scale was the cosmopolitan Clementi, born in Rome, but lived in London from about 1774. Clementi's music, first published in London, Paris, and Vienna, was quickly pirated by a host of unauthorized printers (this was an accepted 18th centiry practice) and disseminated throught Europe. His powerful tight-knit sonatas of the 1780s and 1790s influenced Beethoven from about the turn of the century.

As early as his Opus 2 of 1779 he wrote melodic lines lavishly decorated with altered tones astonishingly like those of Parisian piano style two generations later. And some twenty years afterwards he composed music that seems comfortable at home in the new century. Clementi characteristically indulges in lucuriant melodic ornament, strong chormaticism, far-flung tonal relashionships, and long stretches of melliflous passage work. These are all familiar traits of Romantic piano music. Clementi's career prefigured that of many 19th century pianist-composers ina nother way as weel. From the late 1790s he became increasingly involved in the "music business": in manufacture and sale of pianos and in music publishing and editing. From 1798 until 1830 Clementi and Co. was one o fthe world's major vendors of these necessiteis of musical life.

### Dusík

Jan Ladislav Dusík was born in Behomia and practiced his craft as pianist and composer in Germany, Holland, and France before coming to London (as a refugee from the French Revolution) in 1789 until 1810, when the collapse of his business ventures forced his departure. Moving restlessly during the Napoleonic years from Hamburg to the service of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (himself an ambitious composer), and then to Paris as music director to Prince Talleyrand, Dusík gained wide international recognition as a virtuoso pianist and composer. His style matured in the decade spent in London. Like his older colleague Clementi, he devoted gis most serious and fuitful efforts to his solo piano sonatas, some 32 in all.

A characteristic late sonata of Dusík's is his Opus 61 (C 211) in F# minor. Several enduring trairs of romantic keyboard styles may be seen here. A weakening of the traditional tonic-dominnat axis of sonata-tyoe movements results from the introduction of foreign tonalities that function as ornamental neighboring keys to the principal ones. But perhaps even more innovative are the substantial stretches of genuinely indeterminate tonality effected by ubiquitous diminished seventh chords and chromatic shifts. Fast figurations for both hands requiring large leaps and intricate changes of direction, and even faster multi-octave arpeggios and scales reflect the predilections of a new breed of "public" pianist.

### John Field

A younger piano composer within the London orbit was Johan Baptist Cramer. About 1788 he madehis debut both as a composer and as a concert performer. His keyboard etudes were praised by Beethoven, and they alone of all his music are still used for study today.

Of more intrinsic and historical interest is the piani music of John Field, native of Dublin who came to London in 1793, became under the tutelage if Clementi a recognized virtuoso at an early age, and accompanied his teacher to Russia in 1803, there to remain for most of his life. Pictued in contemporary accounts as an awkward, tractable young man—and later as a dissolute alcoholic—Field was nonetheless and almost legendary performer whose style of writing and playing for the paino exerted a decisive effect upon the virtuosos of the next generation: Chopin, Liszt, Thalberg, and others. In comparison with his London contempoaries he had a dramatic reduction in sonata and sonatalike pieces. Only 4 solo keyboard sonatas, 3 of them published in 1801 and dedicated to Clementi. 

> The bulk of Field's keyboard music consists of shorter pieces adorned with all sorts of names: there are familiar-soundinng rondos, variations, polonaises, and etudesl more avantgarde are the designations "walts", "romance", and "pastorale". One type became Field's special province: his fifteen nocturnes for piano wer apparently the first such pieces. and served as a model for Chopin and other Romantic keyboard composers. Field's nocturnes characteristically present a lyrical, sometimes lavishly ornamented molody for the right hand supported by a wide-ranging arpeggiated accompaniment. Most often the harmonic motion is slow, as individual sonorities are sustained through extensive tonic pedal points. This allows for special "atmospheric" effects by lavish use of pedal—it was this trait of Field's music, in fact, that Robert Schumann singled out in 1835 as the Irishman's signal contribution to Romantic musical style.

When pianists appeared in public concerts from the time of Mozart until the middle of the 19th century, piano concertos we mosy often played. Publishing concertos was always an expensive and risky business. Difficult music with orchestral acoompaniment was never in much demand in amateur circles. As a result, a great many concertos by leading pianists from this period have been lost—or, as in the case of works by both Clementi and Dusík, preserverd only in more salable arrangements as sonatas.

All seven of Field's known concertos were published in full score during his lifetime. These compositions illustrate certain chraccteristic tendencies in the Romantic piano concerto: the exquisite balance of forces that is the glory of Mozart's and Beethove's concertos is tipped in favor of the solo instrument, the orchestral writing is rather primitive, and the extended harmonic and tonal syntax we have seen in sonatas of the period is exploited. The the first movement of his Third Concerto might have come from a Field nocturne without the minimal orchestral accompaniment.

### Paris

Nearly all the leading pianists of Beethoven's generation (not including Beethoven himself) performed at one time or another in Paris, and all had their music published there. But few were born in France, or were educated there during the tumultuos Napoleonic years or the uncertain Restoration (1815-30), or lived there for any length of time.

Only Friederich Kalkbrenner and Henri Herz (1803-88) achieved international standing, and neither was originally French. In general, Paris during the Beethoveinian years was more a consumer than a producer of pianists and piano music.

Beethoven's own city of Vienna surely produced more distinguished pianist-composers during the early decades of the 19th century than any other. Most were born elsewhere, a remarkable number of them in nearby Bohemia.

## Czerny, Moscheles, Hummel

Beethoven's faithful pupil and frind Carl Czenze (1791-1857) was born of Bohemian parentage in Vienna and sent virtually his entire life there. Most valued among pianists for his prodigious output of keyboard exercises, Czerny is always seen as the archetypal pedagogue rather than a creator, despite compiling some 1000 musical opera, nearly all of them for piano.

More cosmopolitan, and influential as a composer, was the Bohemian-born pianist Ignaz Moscheles who was instructed by Albrechtsberger and Salieri in Vienna, and befriended by Beethoven. In 1821 he took residence in London. Collaborated with his former student Menndelssohn and with Schumann in the founding of the Leipzig Conservatory. Moscheles efforts reflect a continuing adherence to the manner of middle-period Beethoven. Moscheles to some extent shared the fate of Craner abd Czerby. Mosy of his compositions, boyth the frankly a la mode ones and those that wer emore serioursly motivated, passed quickly out of fashion; his piano etudes alone enjoyed a longer currency.

Moscheles' older collegue Johan Nepomuk Hummel, was even more cosmopolitan and veriagated. Boen in Pressburh (now Bratislava), but came to Vienna to study with Mozart, Haydn, Albrechtsberger and Salieri. Hummel as a child charmed audiences in Vienna with his elegant, fluent style of playing, and did the same in London as early as 1791. While maintaining a long-term employment at the court of Stuttgart and Weimar, he produced an unceasing stream of compositions: church music, operas, chamer music, and a great mass of piano music. Like many piano composers of his time, Hummel wrote a proportionately small number of solo sonatas—there are nine—but invested them with his best efforts.

> The piece is a good illustration of the ever-present contradictions in style an dintent among public musicians of this time: popular success and serious artistic attainment often prove immiscible. But in this instance posterity judged well; Hummel's F# minor sonata is a worthy work, and one of the few of his compositions that remained in the repertories of succeding generations.

Václav Jan Tomásek (1774-1850) was described by his famous student Eduard Hanslick as the "musicla Dalailama" of Prague. What attracted most attention, in his time and ours, are his numerous smaller piano pices with the intriguing names "eclogue", "dithyramb" and "rhapsody". On the strengh of these compositions (or perhaps of their names), Tomásek has often been pointed to as a founder of the Romantic "character piece"—a composition with its own special personality and expression, as opposed to one that is merely representative of a genre.

The named he chose are all poetic terms from classical antiquity. An eclogue is a pastoral poem, a dithyramb a kind of poetry in praise of Bacchus; rhapsody was the name for a selection for recitation from epic poetry—this last being the only one of these titles adopted by later Romantic composers.

## Schubert's Piano Music

> If any single external factor distinguishes Schubert from all the other pianists mentioned here, it is that he was not a public virtuoso, and the kind and quality of his keyboard music reflect this crucial distinction.

His keyboard compositions fall roughly into two categories: modest pieces appropiate for domestic amateur performance and large-scale compositions in severlal movements, in which Schubert patiently explored the most profound and intricate possibilities of his art.

> In the piano sonata 960 in B-flat, Schubert develops to the full his unique gifts for melodic invention, captivating piano sound and figuration, and striking key relationships. And in all four movements can be heard, once again, Schubert's habitual evocation of the dance. But However clearly this music displays the composer's personal stamp, it is nonetheless a sonata, and for Schubert that category had special implications: it carried with it the inviolable compositional traditions of Haydn, Mozart, and especially Beethoven. In both outer movements Schubert is at pains to engage in determined developmental procedures that are not really native to his style, but which in this case succeed brilliantly.

The harmonic similarity to the opening theme (also dancelike) of the finale of Beethoven's Strign Quartet Op. 130 in the same key, ocompleted just before his final illness and death, in unmistakable. Thus in his last major composition Schubert acknowledged the sort of debt to his older contemporary that was to prove a burden to nearly every composer of instrument music of the 19th century. Bu he did so in a composition that fully establishes his own greatness in the very traditions to which Beethoven seemed to have gained proprietary claim.

# Chapter 5: the Lied: Schubet and His Predecessors

There was a growing admiration for the "primitive". In the late 18th century it appeared under two separate guises. 
Whatever seemed untamed and irregular, as in the 19th century English garden, or in the plays of Shakespeare. 
Others saw simplicity, naivete, and spontaneity as the most desirable attributes in works of art an literature. This the sensibility of the unspoiled peasant, the "nobel savage", and the child were heald up as models for the artist by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his contemporaries in England. "Many a genius probably there has been which could neither write not read" Edward Young. Human nature unsulied by civilization became a favourite pursuit of the educated classes; from about 1750 there was enthusiasm thought Western Eurupe for folk poetry, and for works of folk art and music.

It was widely believe that modern fol or primitive poetry, like the epics of Homer, was meant to be sung; the German word "Lied" referred interchangeably to a poem with music or without. As early as 1736 a little volume of simple poems set to simple tunes appeared in Leipzig under the imposing title *The Singing Muse on the Plisse River* by "Sperontes", Jogannes Sigismund Scholze (1705-50). Plainly intended for amateurs, most often the music was printe on teo staves with the text in between; that way it could be performed at the keyboard by a single person.

## The Berlin School

The principal certer for Lied composition was Berlin, the first influential treatise appeared there in 1753: Christian Gottlieb Krause's.

Heinrich Christoph Koch defined th Lied:

> A lyrical poem of several stanzes, intended to be sung, and united with a melody that is repeates for each stanze and that also is of such a nature that it can be sung by anyone who has a normal and reasonably flexible voice, whether he has any training in the art or not.

The agreed-upon simplicity and amateur status of the Leid seems to have kept most of the leading 18th century German composers at a distance. Haydn and Mozart contributed some examples, but they did not reflect serious intent. The Leid remained in the province of minor North German composers.

Central figures in the cultivations of this "opera for the bourgeoisie", and hence in the dissemination of the Lied, were Johann Adam Hiller (1728-1804) and his student Christian Gottlob Neefe (1748-98), from about 1780 the teacher of young Beethoven.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), the literary figure who towered over German letters for several decades around the turn of the 19th century, showed a lively interest in the Lied from about 1770, when he cato to know Herden in Strassburg. His *Trost in Thranen* written in March 1803 was later set by about 35 composers, oincluding Schubert, Loewe, and Brahms. Goethe's influence upon the fortunes of the German Lied is hard to overestimate. He always threw in his lot with the old doctrines of simplicity: little in the way of melismas, melodic ornament, or word repetition was permitted, and strophic poems required strophic music. He expressed preferences in composers: Johan Friedrich Reichardt (1752-1814) and Karl Friedrich Zelter (1758-1832), his "musical advisers", won his approval; he criticized Beethoven an Spohr, and virtually ignored Schubert.

Reichardt and Zelter were both solid members of the North German school of composers and music theorists. 
Reichardt was an enormously prolifica author of musical travel books and benign musci criticism, editor of journals, and composer of Singspiele and more than 1000 Lieder.
Zelter, Goethe's confidant an  the teacher of Feliz Mendelssohn, was long a leading figure in the musical life of Berlin. From 1800 he directed the famous Singakademie, a musical organization that regularly presented works of major importance, including the revival of Bach's St Matthew Passion in 1829, conducted by the young Mendelssohn. Wrote some 200 Lieder many to texts by Goethe. Often more adventutous in text setting that Reichardt, Zelter also tended to allow the piano part a greater degree of independence.

The so-called Berlin Lieder school was perpetuated by two younger composers, Ludwig Berger (1777-1839) and Bernhard Klein (1793-1832). Most of Berger's *Liederspiel* are unpretentious and consistently strophic. In the last one, however, he includes arpeggios that show some of the theatricality usual in the contemporary ballad. Klein followed the simplicity tradition.

## Southern Germany and Vienna

In Sourther Germany, removed from the somewhat ponderous influence of the Berlin School, Leider had more variety. Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg (1760-1802), kapellmeister at the court of Stuttgart, published 7 volumes of Lieder and ballads; the latter became models for their genre. For *Leonore*, a very long poem, Zumsteeg provides 950 measures of constantly shifting styles of music for this recitative, simple song, arioso, and dramatic piano interludes. Such a through-composed setting became a norm in the ballad repertory. In *Die Leiden des jungen Werthers* (the Sufferings of the Young Werther), Wertyher, a prototypefor the familiar Romantic hero. Tremolo figures in the right hand imitate the howling of the wind, a nd a precipitous downward scale depicts a water fall. They are much like the devices of melodrama a popular type of entertainment with spoken text and pictorial acoompanying music cultivated by Georg Benda (1722-95).

In the last decades of th 18th century, Leider were vigorously cultivated in and around Vienna. In compositions by Joseph Anton Steffan (1726-97) and Leopold Kozeluch (1747-1818), for example, the incursion of features from dramatic music—from the opera, cantata, and melodrama—is again much more in evidence than in Northern Germany. In his more that 50 German songs with piano accompaniment Beethoven reflects this and other traditions in song writing to which he fell heir.

As a Leider composer Beethoven is best known for his *An die ferne Geliebte* (1816) often described as the first Leider cycle. Tthis work actually exhibits a good deal more cohesion than virtually all succeding examples of the genre. All the individual songs of this cycle are connected by modulatory piano interludes. For the last stanze of the last poem, Beethoven returns to the music of the first, noe in an elaborate version in its original key. Most telling a s a unifying device, is his consistent use of an old practice, strophic variation, for the successive stranzas of individual poems. 

> Whatever the ingenuities, this music is, by Beethoven's standards, primitive; as a composer of Lieder he never reached the heights he achieved in his instrumental music. But it stood very high in the estimation of the Romantics and provided an important precedent for the growth of the song cycle.

## Schubert

Inherited th same traditions in Lied compositions that Betthoven did. But, in his more than 600 Lieder, he explored and exanded the potentialities of the genre as no composer before him. The earliest are in the dramatic ballad style of his time.

It has often been said that Schubert was not particularly discriminating in the poetry he chose to set. But the poets to whom he turned most frequentrly were the most distinguished of his day, notably Goethe (some 65 settings) and Schiller (about 40).

Goethe's *Wandrers Nachtlied II* (1780), probably the most praised poem in the German language. The elegance of the language, the artful enjambments whereby syntax is continuous between lines, and the congurence of sound and sense—all these show a level of sophistication far removed from the mode of "folklike-ness" then current. By its very delicacy of diction and meaning, its metrical irregularity and brevity, the poem creates serious problems for the composer. Schubert was one of more than 100 composers in the 19th century who rose to the challenge. Schubert shows considerable respect for Goethe's irregular poetic meter, reproducing it with remarkable fathfulness in a nearly syllabic setting.

Among Schubert's finest accomplishments in any genre are his two Lieder cycles on poems of Wilhelm Muller: *Die Schone Mullerin* (D. 795, 1823) and *Winterreise* (D. 911, 1827).

Schubert's songs were not intended for concert performance, as they are most ofter heard these days. They were typically sung at private salonsor at gatherings of the composert's friends called "Schubertiads". At Schuber's only concert, given on March 29, 1828, he and Vogl in fact performed a half dozen of his songs; but both the concert and the public airing of his Lieder were altogether exceptional events in his composer's career. The Viennese press took no notice either—an imminent appearance in Vienna of the virtuoso Paganini absorbed most of their attention—and the possibility of another concert nover arose, since he died only a few months later.


# Chapter 6: The Rise of Nineteenth-Century Opera

During the second halt of th 18th century opera remained the most popular form of public musical entratainmente. More specifically the Italian opeta, that despite all barreirs of culture and language, dominated European stages everywhere except in France.

Two types of Italian opera flourished: opera seria and opera buffa.

### Opera Seria

Opera seria was identified with the works of its magisterial librettist, Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782). Metastasio's tenure as court poet in Vienne from 1730 until his dead demosntrates the international character of the opera seria. Still a court entretainment, it derives its elevated subjects from ancient history and legend: Assyrians, Babylonians, Athenians, Romans, and others. Withg only a few exceptions these operas end happily.

A satirical but fairly accurate recepe for the construction of an opera seria was provided in the 1760s by the German-turned-French litterateur Friedrich Melchior Grimm:

> There must be three acts with one change of scene in each; sic main characters including two pairs of lovers; several "confidants" are required; each of the principals must be assigned two arias per act and must always exit immediatly after singing each of them (to allow for applause).

The supremacy of this kind of opera was virtually uncontested until about the 1760s, and all the leading opera composers contributed to it: Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel, Johan Adolf Hasse, Gluck, and Niccolo Piccinni.

### Opera Buffa

As opera became increasingly the province of public theaters late in the century, opera seria progressively lost ground to the several types of comic opera, particularly Italian opera buffa. Far less rigidly coddified tha opera seria, it admitted a wide variety of characters (every day people). Certain stock roles emerged; one was the basso buffo, a clownish figure, usually a servant, who characteristically sang fast syllabic music. The more humble characters often sang in dialect, especially Neapolitan variety. Simple recitative an arias of varying types and proportions dominated the sequence of events. But ensembles of soloists were commonplace, particularly in the increasingly elaborate finales.

As the 18th century wore on, opera buffa took some elements from opera seria. Counts and countesses—often treated satirically—sang "high style" da capo arias, and serious dramatic situations were seriously presented. Especially in the works of the librettist Carlo Goldoni (1702-93), the leading characters were oftern a pair of lovers. Such librettos increasingly attracted the best-known composers of the time—Baldassare Galuppi (1706-85), Niccolo Piccinni (1728-1800), Domenico Cimarosa (1749-1801), Giovanni Paisiello (1740-1816), and Mozart.

Opera seria also changed markedly. Especially in the hands of composers working outside the Italian states. Generous use of chorus an element originally borrowed from French models, and a partial abandonment of the standard alternation of recitative and set arias.

By the seconf decade of the 19th century the most distinguidhed composers of Italina opera were growing old. Mayr's Neapolitan colleague Nicolo Zingarelli (1752-1837) had virtually finish his operatic careeer, and Giovanni Paisiello, perhaps the most admired of them all, died in 1816 at the age of 76. Others began their careers in Italy, but sought greener pastures elsewhere at the first signs of success. The Italian operatic stage needed rejuvenation if it was to retain its European hegemony. There was, in fact, such a rejuvenation, and it was almost exclusively the achievent of one man, Giacchino Rossini.

## Rossini

Born in Pesaro, on the Adriatic coasts of the Papal States, in February 1792. Both parents employed by the theater. Rossini's boyhood was repeatedly disturbed by the chaos of Napoleon's Italian campaigns. After the family moved to Bologna in 1804 young Rossini was enrolled in the venerable Liceo Musicale, where he received instuction in singing, solfeggio, piano, and cello. By 1809 he was accompanying from the keyboard at various theaters around Bologna and had produced a fair number of rather tentative compositoins, both vocal and instrumental. In 1810, at the age of 18, he made his debut as an opera composer with the one-act *farsa, La Cambiale di matrimonio*, presented at the Teatro San Moisé in Venice. Its success was immediate and Rossini's meteoric career was underway. Two years layer his *La Pietra del paragone*, called a *melodramma giacosa* (another of the rather fluid collection of names the Italians applied to their comic opera), was performed at La Scala in Milan; the resulting acclaim prompted a run of 53 performances and made Rossini Italy's leading composer.

Rossini's operas, both serious and comic, regularly begin with an Introduzione consisting of (1) a section for chorus, often with solo interjections by minor characters, (2) a slow section, frequently an aria for a major character, and (3) a final fast section for chorus and soloists.

By 1816 simple recitative was nearing the end of its usegul life, and composers including Rossini hired assistants to write it.

*The Barber of Seville*, destined to become one of the most popular operas if all time (in 1825 it became the first opera ever sung in Italian in New York), opened in Rome in 1816 to a tumultuously hostile audience that threatened to stop it dead at its premiere. The Roman audience resented this opera as an act of impertinence, since Paisiello's opera on the same subject, first performed in 1782, was still regarded with special reverence there. Rossini's work seemed to provoke a direct confrontation between the old and the new. In Rossini's, all the soloists are called upon to sing a great deal more coloratura figuration, which in traditional opera buffa had been reserved for the more "exalted" characters. Another difference is his obsessive rhythmic repetitions that can be both exhilerating and comic.

However *The Barber of Seville* may differ from the classic opera buffa in style and structure, it remains faithful in spirit to the genre cultivated by Cimarosa, Paisiello, and the Mozart of *Cosi fan tutte*. Sharply drawn comic characters and situations and perfectly calculated pacing contribute to a musical drama whose essence is wit and parody, with scarcely a sign of the earnestness and sentiment that had began to color much of comic opera in the waning 18th century.

Rossini visited Vienna for a festival in 1822 and visited the ailing Beethoven, who adviced him: "Never try to do anything but opera buffa; wanting to succeed in another genre would be trying to force your destiny." However, Rossini had already composed a good number of opera seria. He was often bound by contract. In the year after the visit, Rossini composed two new serious operas for Venice; the second of these, *Semiramide*, was his last work written for an Italian stage.

Ater a rather uneventful but suplemely lucrative stay in London in 1824, Rossini and his wife settled in Paris, where he was showered with honors and official recgnition. His effrots at opera there were French adaptations of Italina works. After having negotiated an astonishing contract with the French State (signed in person by King Charles X) granting him an unconditional lifetime annuity of 600 francs, Rossini at the age of 37 produced his last opera, *William Tell* (1829), and proceeded to live in semiretirement for another fouty-odd years. 

## Donizetti and Bellini

Opera composers of a slightly younger generation were coming to dominate the stages of Italy. Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Saverio Mercadante (1795-1870), and Vincenzo Bellini (1801-35).

Donizetti, born in Bergamo, student of Simon Mayr, had an opera *Enrico, conte di Borgonia* heard in 1818, and before his career ended in 1844, he had more than 70 musical dramas to his credit. Accepted an invitation to the Theatre Italien in Paris, and the best known of his late works were all composed for the Parisian stage.

Increasingly, this generation turned to a variaty of opera seria taking shape in th 1820s and 1830s, that without essential modification was to dominate Italian opera for the ramiander of the century.

> Gone are the clockworlike conflicts and intrigues and the ultimately rational act of amnesty granted by a benign sovereign. Scourged by war and disruption, and excited by the stirrings of democratic and revolutionary sentiment in political movements leding to the Risorgimiento, Italian audiences were attracted to a drama governed less by decorum and reason than by string action and passion.

Vincenzo Bellini was a student of another eminent opera composer active at the turn of the 19th century, Nicolo Zingarelli. Born in Sicily in 1801, and educated largely in Naples. He moved to paris in 1833, and like Rossini and Donizetti, composed his last important work(*I Puritani*) for the French stage. He produced only ten operas— a small number by contemporary starndards even if allowace is made for the brevity of his life— and all of them are of the serious type. The subjects are the familiar ones of Romantic Italian opera: tales of hopeless love and violent death drawn from turbulent episodes in European history or from the dramas of Shakespeare, Scribe, Or Hugo.

Both write music designed mostly to offer audiences the pleasures of a brilliant signing. That sinuous, decorated melody of Bellini's most expressive manner, widely imitated in subsequent vocal and instrumental music, came to figure prominently in the future of Romantic musical style.

## Opera in France

In th 18th centiry only France maintained a native operatic practice of sufficient vitality to resist the Italian domination. Though some of its roots can easily be traced to 17th century Italian practice, French opera grew in its own way.

Like the Italian, the French had two distinct classes of opera, serios and comic (the *tragedie lyrique* and the *opera comique*), and two separate theaters for their performace. Tragedie lyrique, as established by Jean Baptiste Lully (1632-87) and his librettist Philippe Whuinault (1635-88), was for more tha a century the official French opera, sanctioned by the Crown and regulated throgh the Academie Royale de Musique. The music was invariably decorous; there was none of the gymnastic virtuosity of Italian arias. Recitative in tragediew lyrique was measured—free secco recitative, it was widely believed, was suitable only for the Italian language. Instead of the predictable alternation of recitative and aria, French serious opera presented a fluid procession of measured recitative, arioso, short arias, and choruses and dances, these last often as divertissements unrelated to the central drama. This pattern remained nearly intact for generations: in the works of Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) that dominated much of the 18th century.

Comic opera in France grew up with much less official sanctions and restraint, and it was always more subject to Italian influence than the courtly tragedie lyrique. the most popular of 1l8th century Italian comic operas, such as Pergolesi's *La serva padrona*, were regularly mixed into the standard indigenous repertory at the Theatre de l'Opera Comique. After the mid 18th century, comic opera came to be treated in a more serious fashion. Librettos of considerable literary substance were provided by Charles Simon Favart (1710-92), Michel Sedaine (1719-97).

Often the subjects were middle-class people. Some libretos induled in pointed social commentary. Not only the nobility, but the clergy and othe rpeople of the educated classes, physicians in partucular, were objects of broad satire.

As the winds of revolution blew ever stronger over the land, royalty and others of the privileged classes were seen as villains, not victims. 

While Italian opera seria of the 18th century seemingly exerted a determinant influence upon the destiny of Italian 19th century opera, the historical continuity in French opera unmistakably followed the course of opera comique. One reason is the tragedie lyrique was subject to ponderous supervision, was unable to adjust to changing times and tastes. 
Another was that during the revolutionary period the various successive regimes made use of the pioular and traditionally liberal opera comique as a powerful instrument of propaganda. The composers were the same who provided music for the spectacular republican *fetes*, and the opera, in both style and idea, came to resemble them.

These festivals were conceived as outdoor public spectacles in which the entire populace theoretically should participate; vows of allegiance to republican principles were to be renewed, military and political events celebrated, and the fires of revolutionary fervor kindled anew. One of the most elaborate of these celebrations was the *Fete de l'Etre Supreme* of 1794. Music such as F. J. Gossec's *Hymme a l'Etre Supreme*, E. N. Mehul's *Chant du depart* and the *Marseillaise* itself (by Rouget de Lisle). The government took care that such political songs were widely distributd among the populace; thus the rhythms of military band music and the plain but rousing sounds of what one contemporary observer called the "hymnic" style were heard on every side (theater, opera). Foremost among the composers of revolutionary opera was the newly arrived Italian, Cherubini. Ubiquitous male ensemble singing, moreover, an enlarged orchestra, and a spectacular conflagration at the end show clearly the direction French opera was to take during the ensuing decade. Much admired by Haydn and Beethoven, and in a later generation by Schumann, Cherubini exerted an influence upon the music of his time far more powerful than his present near-eclipse would suggest.

During the years of the Napoleonic empire another resident Italian musician, Gasparo Spontini rose to great prominence. Officially named "Composer to the Empress" in 1805, he provided cantatas for the celebration of such events as Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz (December, 1805) and the birthday of the empress. In 1807 his first full-scale work for the French stage, *La Vestale*, was a popular triumph. The Institut de France pronounced it the "best opera of the last decade".

In the French opera of revolutionary and Napoleonic times, certain familiar Romantic themes and scenes began to emerge with growing frequency. Pinturesque and exotic landscapes, storms at sea, violent political struggle, mass crowd scenes,and musical forces of great power and variety were the stuff of French opera in the first 2 decades of the century. During this period of foundations for Rossini's Guillaume Tell and for French grand opera of the 1830s and 1840s were firmly laid.

## German Romantic Opera

Before the 19th centiry there was no indigenous tradition of German opera to compare with those of Italy and France. There were scattered attempts ot establish something like a German version of opera seria in both the 17th and 18th century. the public opera theater in Hamburg produced German operas on serious subjects from 1678 to 1737. In 1777 the Mannheim court saw an opera on a German historical subject, *Gunther von Schwarzburg*, with a libretto by Anton Klein and music by Ignaz Holzbauer, it became the first German opera published in full score. The style (music and libretto) was borrowed from opera seria.

Of much greater consequence was the adaptation, mainly in North Germany, of the modest English ballad opera; in the 1740s and 1750s German audiences showed enthusiasm for translations of pleasant and unprepossessing works such as Charles Coffey's *The Devil to Pay* and *The Merry Cobbler*. The were cakked Singspiele. Christian Deliz Weisse (1726-1804) of Leipzig, a prime mover in the adaptation of such English musical plays was also influential in the ensuing phase in the growth of German comic opera. In the 1760s and 1770s he colaborated with musicias sucha as Johann Adam Hiller, also of Leipzig, that set the genre firmly upon a familiar path toward seriousness and respectability. Some were translation from the current French comic opera with new music by various composers. As time passed, simple tales about farmers, merchants, and journeyman laborers gradually gave way, as in the opera comique, to romantic plots of ill-fated love, magic and enchantment and adventurous rescues. The composer Georg Benda (1722-95) at the court of Gotha marked this progressive "elevation of subject matter with his *Der Dorfjahrmarkt* (The Village Fair) of 1775 and *Juile and Romeo* of 1776.
 
In Vienna the Singspiel, was well known from about mid-century. Mozart;s two mature Singspele were supreme examples of the genre as cultivated in Vienna. *Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail* (The Abduction from the Seralio) in 1782, showed the Viennese taste for exotic subjects. Then there are accompanied recitatives and show-stopping coloratura arias reminiscent of opera seria in full bloom. *The Magic Flute* (*Die Zauberflote*) of 1791, the work that contributed more than any other to Mozart's reputation in the 19th century, shows specific traits of the nascent German Romantic opera.

In the subsequent two decades Italian opera regained its supremacy in Vienna, climaxing with the triumphs of Rossini that began in 1812. 

### Schubert

However little we may associate his name with opera, Schubert composed no fewer than 9 complete German operas between 1814-23. Only two of them, *Die Zwillingsbruder* (The Twin Brothers, 1819) and *Die Zauberharfe* (The Magic Harp, 1819-20), were performed during his lifetime. Six of the fourteen are melodramas after the manner of Georg Benda. Choruses of troubadours and knights reflect the *Singverein* style, and the instrumental music, like so much in Schubert, carries unmistakable echoes of the dance.

All these works show an allegiance to established modes of Viennese musical drama. 

In a letter to Leopold Kupelwieser, brother of the libretist for Fierrabras, Schuber wrote in 1824:

> The opera by your brother... has been declared unusable, and thus no claim has been made on my music. Castelli's opera, *Die Verschworenen*, has been set in Berlin by a local composer and revceived with acclamation. In this way I seem once again to have composed two operas for nothing.

The poor reception of Schubert's operas has often been attributed to bad librettos. But other successful operas of the period also had them. He seem to have thought of opera as a play with added musical numbers ("Castelli's opera"). His music, however attractive, contribute little to the dramatic movement. His operas were no match for the quick wit and sure dramatic pacing of Rossini's musical comedies.

### Louis Spohr

In 1813 the peripatetic composer Louis Spohr freed himself from the ducal court in Gotha to become musical director at a prestigious Viennese thater, the Theater an der Wien. Spohr's *Faust* achieved no more success in Vienna than Schubert's operas.  Viennese audiences at the time seemed to care little for German opera by local composers.

His autobiograph relates:

> Little as I was an admirer of Rossini's music.. yet the applause which "Tancred" had met with in Frankfort was not wholly without influence on the style of my new opera... This explains why the music to "Zemira and Azor" has so much colouring and vocal ornamentation.


### E. T. A. Hoffmann

A figure of considerable importance in the growth of German Romantic opera and Romantic attitudes toward music was Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann (he substituted Amadeus for Wilhelm around 1808 out of admiration for Mozart). E. T. A. Hoffmann's output as an opera composer was neither large nor particularly successful. But in his life and work Hoffmann became a prototype, almost a caricature of the Romantic artist-musician. Trained for a career in law, he cared only for the arts, and in 1808 became musical director of the theater in Barberg. Having virtually no experience conducting, he stepped down after two months.

He suffered grievously from that malady common to Romantic artists, a lack of Systematic early training. In both music and painting he always retained certain marks of the amateur. From about 1810 he turned increasingly to the sort of prose writing that made him famous: extravagantly metaphorical music criticism—though ofter fortified with careful analysis—and fanciful tales and novels.

A recurrent figure in his work os the half-mad kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler, who represents at once the consummate Romantic musicie's sensibility and something of Hoffmann himself. In Hoffmann's portrayal the artist is guided by forces inaccessible to others, and he is oftern ill-suited to existence in ordinary society. His life and his art are indivisible. Such notions were immensely atractive to succeeding generations of writers and musicians. Robert Schumann adopted much of Hoffmann's manner in his earlier prose writings. Wagner described himself in his 16th year as "on fire with the maddest mysticism, chiefly from perusing Hoffmann's works"; in his maturity he drew on Hoffmann's tales in the librettos of *Tannhauser* and *Die Meistersinger*. Hoffmann's story *Don Juan, eine fabelhaftige Begebenheit* (1813) influences a whole century of views about Mozart's masterpiece, including Kiekegaad's famous exposition in *Either/Or* (1843).

Undine, Hoffmann's only opera to achieve any public notice was applaused at its Berlin performances in 1816 by Carl Maria von Weber, the composer often described as the originator of German Romantic opera—though Hoffmann, Spohr, Schubert, and perhasp Wenzel Muller and even Mozart might have equal claim in this distinction.

### Carl Maria von Weber

Weber's unsettled childhood in a traveling theatrical family effectively precluded early systemaic education in anything. Nonetheless he showed marked abilities from an early age in both musci and writing. Early on he attracted noble patronage and cami into contact with important musicians such as Michael Haydn and later Gottfried Weber. His operas enjoyed multiple performances and he managed to be a director of major opera houses. Weber's life as a composer and musician seemed a realization of all Hoffmann had hoped for himself.

In Silvana, with a libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer, is in some ways a concatenation of Romantic elements already familiar from French opera. In *Abu Hassan*, set to a libretto adapted by Hiemer from *The Thousand and One Nights*, Weber reverted to a neraly unalloyed Classic style, producing a delightful "Turkishh" comedy with aclear debt to Mozart's *Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail*. *Abu Hassan* is scarcely indicative of the direction Weber's career as an opera composer was to take. Nearly ten years elapsed before Weber composed another opera. During this time most of his energies were channeled into conducting. During these years, he was affected by the exposure to prevailing winds of Romantic aesthetic doctrine. In heidelberg he associated with Clemens Brentano and Achum von Arnim, compiles of that collection of supposed folk poetry that fired the imagination of generations of German Romantics, *Des Knaben Wunderhorn* (The Youth's Magic Horn). His contacts with E. T. A Hoffman began in Bamberg in 1811 and continued until Hoffmann's unfavorable review of his *Der Freishchutz* (1821). Many episodes of Weber's *Tonkunstlersleben* whose hero Felix resembles both Weber and Kapellmeister Kreisler, show Hoffmann's influence. He attempted to found a secre *Harmonischer Verein* (Musical Society) in 1810, in which the members were to adopt bizarre pseudonyms and fo battle against all philistinism in music.

The composer's artistic theories were concentrated largely in opera, and in his review of Hoffmann's *Undine* he airs some of them:

> In no variety of artwork is this [fragmentation of parts] so difficult to avoid—and consequently so often present—as in the opera. By opera I understand, of course, the opera which the German desires—an artwork complete in itself, in which the partial contrubutions of the related and collaborating arts sblend together, disappear, and in disapeering, some how forma a new world.
>
> As a rule a few striking musical numbers determine the success of the whole. Only rarely are these numbers, agreeably stimulating in the moment of their hearing, finally dissolved, as the properly should be, in the great general impression. For one must come first to admire the whole; then, on closer acquaintance, one may take pleasure in the beauty of the separate parts of which the whole is composed.

Similar criticism to the "detached number" construction in opera had been leveled at the standard recitative-aria structure well back in the previous century by Francesco Algarotti, Gluck, and others. but 18th century opera theorists usually criticized this arrangement because it encouraged the hegemony of the aria; What they wanted above all was dramatic integrity, an opera in which music was a "handmaind of poetry". Weber advocated instead a thorough amalgamation of the constituent arts in opera to produce a whole greater that the sum of its parts. This view grows directly from tenets of German Romantic aesthetics, and its influence upon the future of opera in the 19th century was decisive.

In the quotation above and in most of Weber's opera criticism are pronounced sentiments of nationalism.

> The Italians and French have created for themeselves a form of opera which they practice contentedly. Not so the German. Always curious, and always in search of progress, he seizes for himself the best features of the others—but uses them in a more profound way.

Such declarations sounded well to German ears in 1817, when the Napoleonic disorders had finally been put to rest and feelings of national pride began to grow strong.

Weber's *Der Freischutz* (1821) was concidered by many the quintessential German Romantic opera (it has been performed more than any other in the German language). It is laden with recognizable strains of German Romanticism.

> There are in *Der Freischutz* two peincipal elements that can be recognized at first sight—hunting life and the rule of demonic powers as personified by Samiel. [...] The tone colour of the scoring for forest and hunting life was easy to find: the horns provided it. The difficulty lay only in finding for the horns new melodies that would be both simple and popular. For this purpose Isearched among folk melodies, and I have careful study to thank if this part of my task is successful. I did not even shrink from using parts of these tunes—shall I say, as far as the actual notes are concerned?... The most important part, to my mind, is in Max's words "I am entrapped by sinister forces". I had to remind the hearer of these "dark powers" by means of tone-colour and melody as often as possible... I gave a great deal of thought to the question of what was the right principal coloring for this sinister element. Naturally it had to be dark, gloomy colour—the lowest register of the violins, basses, particularly the lowest register of the clarinet, which seemed especially suitable for depicting the sinister, then the mournful sound of the basson [...].

Weber seems to say that the foremost trait of German opera is eclescticism—the appropriation of "the best features of the others." *Der Freischutx* illustrates the principle well. Its realistic out-of-door  scenes, both picturesque and violend, had been known in French opera since the last years of the previous century. Frequent choruses and dances are reminiscent of French forebears and and many of the characters, particularly Max and Agathe's cousin Aennchen, are familiar types from opera comique. The majority of productions he conducted at Prague and Dresden were German adaptations of French operas. Nor are Italian traits entirely laking, whatever Weber's professed bad opinions. Clear in the Romanze und Aria of Aennchen, the beginning of the aria proper has the sort of lively and uniform rhythmic figure, as weel as the harmonic simplicity one expects of, say, Donizetti.

One of Weber's notable achievements is his construction of extended unified musical scenes. A famous example is the Wolf's Glen episode. However familiar many of Weber's musical devices, in this opera we can see at work certain remarkable principles of large scale construction: musical themes, tonalities, and orchestral timbres come to represent specific dramatic and scenic motifs. If the individual elements are well known, the consistent attempt to create intricate interconnections between them is novel.

*Der Freischutz* gained Weber an international reputation. Staged thorought Germany and in notoriously mutilated versions in France and England, this opera won him a commission from London in 1825 to conduct three of his works: *Der Freischutz*, the music of *Preciose*, and a new opera, *Oberon, or the Elf-king's Oath*. Never in robust health, and now suffering from tuberculosis, Weber nevertheless set off for England in January 1826, and after a reasonably successful series of performances died there the following summer. If good intentions were thwarted by weaknesses in the libretto of *Euryanthe*, this problems is even more acute in *Oberon*.

German opera in the earlier ninetheenth centry followed familiar patterns. In the latter part of the 18th century the Singspiel had been progressively enriched by the absortion of foreign influences, especially elements of the opera comique. In its narrowest definition the genre appears a short-lived thing; Wagner's *Tannhauser* (1845) is oftern described as the last one. But certain of its characteristics, especially a tendency toward musical continuity and large-scale unity, were to become fixtures in European operatic practice for the remainder of the century.


# Chapter 7: Paris from 1830 to 1848

Napoleon escaped from exile in 1815, ousted the recently enthoroned Louis XVIII, gathered an army of 350,000, and set out to renew his conquest. The Hundred Days of his return ended decisively with the battle at Waterloo in Belgium. What was astonishing about this is that it could have occurred at all, Napoleon, the wrecker of peace and stability in all Europe, still commanded powerful support in war weary France and elsewhere. The success of this campaign, however temporary, underscored the profound political divisions in Europe. Napoleon still represented for many certain abstract doctrines of the French Revolution: notions such as the sovereignty of the people, the a priori illegitimacy of monarchy, and the equality of all persons before the law.

By 1820 revolutionary movements had toppled the governements of Spain, Naples, and the Ottoman Empire, and in 1825 the tremors of rebellion were felt in Russia. But it was in France that the issues of governmental prerogatives and the rights of the several classes of citizens were more sharply drawn. Louis XVIII had been deposited in the French throne and wwas subject to a *charte* with a bicameral legislature and placed limits on his power. Louis had also become a cautious man and did nothing to disrupt the different classes. His death brought Charles X, the former Count of Artois, believer in the principles of the Old Regime. The collapse came in 1830, in response to the July Ordinances that dissolved the legislature, imposed censorship of the press, and severely limited suffrage. The July Revolution was almost blodless, but its effects were momentous.

The new king, Louis Philippe, called himself "citizen king" and were ordinary clothing. Louis undestood that the power had shifted into the hands of the ascendant bourgeoisie (bankers, manufacturers, merchants). A new "capitalist nobility" was given free hand to speed France's participation in the nascent Industrial Revolution. France for a time showed  a greater toleration for liberal ideas than any other nation on the continent.


## Grand Opera

While the old nobility, traditionally patroons of artistic institutions, solked in the background, the theaters and operas were populated increasingly by well-to-do bourgeoisie. The venerable Opéra (the Académie royale de musique) was let out as a consession to the entrepeneur Louis Véron. He assemble a cohesive group that produced the henre of musical entertainment known as grand opera. Véron's close ties with journalistic circles insued a flood of favorable publicity for his product.

The principal librettist for the grand opera, Wugene Scribe (1791-1861), drew on several traditions for his texts. Most of his subjects, like those of contemporary Italian serious opera, were loosely adapted from post-classical history. These libretos usually have aliberal bias; the nobility are generally made to look bad, and anticlerical sentiment runs strong. 

Of crucial importance for all such spectacles in the grand opera were advanced methods of stagecraft were calculated for the maximum in novelty and realism. Many of the scenic effects were already proven in smaller popular theaters in Paris.

The beginning of the grand opera are discernible as early as Spontinis's *La Vestale* (1807). Auber's *La Muette de Portici* of 1828 and Rossini's *Guillaume Tell* of the following year speeded its development; but it first appears in full flower in the 1830s in two works of the German born composer whose name is inseparably linked with the genre, Giacomo Meyerbeer. After the success of *Robert-le-Diable* in 1831, Meyerbeer collaborated with Scribe and the concerted personnel of the Opéra five years later to produce one of the most pupular operas of all time, *Les Huguenots*. Nothing was sparec in preparation and publicity for this spectacular work. Meyerbeer constructs shifting kaleidoscopic tableaux of soloists and chorus that culminate in full deployment of all forces at hand.

The critical reaction to *Les Huguenots* in Paris—encouraged by financial connections—was unanimously favorable. Even Heine and Berlioz, both of them later critical of Meyerbeer, wrote admiringly of the work. German critisc, however, were unanimously conntemptuos. What Schumann and the other Germans appreciated least was a heightened dramatic realism in *Les uguenots*: a willingless to show scenes of violence and supply them with music that was deliberately unlovely. And they pailed to recognize what is surely Meyerbeer;s principal virtue, a radically experimental orchestration employing new instruments such as the bass clarinet, and producing novel timbres that influenced the sound of the orchestra form Berlioz and Wagner to Richard Strauss.

The public furor over *Les Huguenots* proved impossible to duplicate. Though Meyerbeer accepted another Scribe libretto in 1838, *L'Africaine* (based on the explorations of Vasco de Gama), the work was abandoned when he returned to his native Berlin in 1842. He returend to Paris in 1848 for a successful staging of *Le Prophete* again composed to a libretto by Scribe. In 1865, shortly after the composer's death, *L'Africaine* was at last performed. By this time, new influences were being brought to bear on the Parisian stage (Wagner's *Tannhauser* had been seen there in 1861). Parisian grand opera was tailor-made for a special moment in history; the theatrical and musical forces at the Opéra and the social ambience of Paris were exactly right for *Les Huguenots* in 1836, and, whatever the acclaim won by *Le Prophete*, this high-water mark was not to be repeated.

Gran opera confirmed the place of Paris as the musical center of Europe. A century earlier musicians flocked to Naples and Rome, now even the leading Italian opera composers sought their fortuned in Paris. Opera ther had become a visible triumph of the commercial revolution, complete with an expensive product, substantial investments in advertising, and sizable profits. Scribe produced librettos on something like an assembly line, sketching the plots himself, but leaving all the details to be worked out by his employees. Other facets of music making in Paris were soon influenced by th especial orientation of the opera toward its public; one of the first of these was the rise of the virtuoso instrumental performer.
