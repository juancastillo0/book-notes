# Part II: Accelerate the Transition

# Chapter 7: Win politics and Policy

Nuclear is not mentioned in this politics and policy section book.

A carbon price is the policy that matters most.

1992 conference in rio was the first global event where global warming was the main issue. 1994 rich nations should cut emission and subsidize poorer nations. 1997 (Kyoto) conference first emission reduction target (US senate did not ratify the agreement). All were not successful and for almost two decades climate action in politics stalled, until 2015 (Paris) agreement to stay "well below" 2 C.

## The Policies We Need (Key Results)

By country for the top five global emitters.

- 7.1 Commitments: net-zero 2050, 50% by 2030.
  - 7.1.1 Electricity: 50% by 2025, 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, 100% by 2040.
    - Utilities and infrastructure.
  - 7.1.2 Transportation: Freight ships by 2030. Cars, buses and trucks by 2035. Semi trucks by 2045. 40% flights by 2040.
    - Tax credits and rebates. Pay for old cars. Import duties.
  - 7.1.3 Buildings: Zero-emission residential building standards by 2025, commercial by 2030 and prohibit sales of nonelectric equipment by 2030.
    - Furnaces and stoves to electric. Efficiency and insulation. 
    - Example: California's green building codes
  - 7.1.4 Industry: 50% by 2040, 100% by 2050.
  - 7.1.5 Carbon Labeling: Emission footprint label on all goods.
  - 7.1.6 Leaks: Flaring, venting, methane leaks.
- 7.2 Subsidies: End fossil flue subsidies and for harmful agricultural practices.
  - $296 billion annular direct, $5.2 trillion indirect subsidies (6.5% global GDP. Includes health-care costs from air pollution)
- 7.3 Price on Carbon: Minimum $55 pre ton, rising 5% annually.
- 7.4 Global Bans: HFCs refrigerants and single use plastics for non medical uses.
  - Kigali Amendment to phase ot HFCs (China, USA and India still have not joined)
- 7.5 Government R&D: Double investment


## We'll Always Have Paris

It was thought a price on carbon for Glasgow november 2021 might be achievable.

### Cristiana Figueres

> nationally determined contributions. [...]. As long as we are at net zero globally by 2050, each country can determine its own path

Every five years, countries must report on progress. About 60 countries have a price on carbon, but it's low (usually $2-$10 per ton).

> We haven't really incorporated how we'll regenerate soils or reforest degraded lands or protect standing forests.


## Focusing on the Big Five

### Current emissions

- China 26%
- United States 13%
- European Union and United Kingdom 9%
- India 7%
- Russia 5%
- Rest of the world 35%

See https://speedandscale.com for more information and progress for each country.

### A Sea Change in China

In 2006 China surpassed USA in emissions. China has also invested in more clean energy than any other country. Has a goal of net-zero by 2060. In 2020 accounted for 50% of new renewal generation capacity.

Coal is the biggest problem. 50% of the world's coal is burnt in China and powers 60% of China's electricity. Limit consumption by 2025 and phase-out between 2026 and 2030. First 6 months of consumption in 2020 China issued more permits than for 2018 and 2019 combined. China also finances other countries' fossil fuel projects.

> When you first start, it's just a job. But after some time, when you see the impact you could bring to the country, the people, and the world, it is no longer just a job. It has become a cause, a higher calling. 
> 
> \- Xie Zhenhue, head of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Tsinghua University.

An estimated 49,000 people died in in Beijing and Shanghai in the first half of 2020. Record floods afflicted 70 million and accounted for $33 billion in losses.

### The United States: Back in Business

Largest cumulative emitter with more than 400 gigatons.

Obama's progress in Clean Air Act (fuel efficiency) and investment in clean energy was reversed by Donald Trump. Biden put forward a climate plan with commitments to 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero by 2050. However, some actions require the support form other parts of government.

US investment in energy has when below 1980 level of $8 billion per year (adjusted for inflation). Less than what Americans spend in a week in gasoline.

### Europe: Leading, but Not Fast Enough

Almost two decades ago the EU implemented a cap-and-trade system.

2019 U.K. legislates net-zero by 2050. 2020 EU did the same and a minimum reduction of 55% by 2030.

Berlin pledged carbon neutrality by 2045. German companies are leading clean hydrogen fuel production for cement and steel. However, Germany should accelerate it's coal phaseout to meet its 2030 target.

### India: The Challenge of Growth

Tropical cyclones, rising sea levels and killer droughts have all intensified in the Indian subcontinent.

India has promised to keep it's emissions per capita below developed nations, but its population will rise by 20% to 1.6 billion by 2050. Coupled with a poverty rate of 60% makes a net-zero goal challenging. "India has been consistent for years in saying they would get to net zero through sectoral targets while protecting their biodiversity. And they are meeting their own Paris targets, sector by sector."

Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, has announced an effort to reach 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. This will require and investment of at least $20 billion per year.

#### Cumulative emissions

- United States 25%
- Europe 22%
- China 13%
- Russia 6%
- Japan 4%
- India 3%
- Rest of the world 25%

![](assets/speed_and_scale/cumulative_emissions.svg)

India's per capita emissions are less than half the global average, it is the globe's 3th energy consumer and 4th emitter. Adding the equivalent of Los Angeles' population every year.


### Will Russia Rise to the Challenge?

2.5 gigatons in 2019.

For some it is the main example of why we will not solve climate change. Low commitment and modest short term targets. Putin has swinged from objecting the science to saying that it will be beneficial for some parts of Russia.

> Russia's Energy Strategy 2035 is a big step backward. It calls for boosting oil and gas production while expanding petroleum exports. Solar and wind have no place in the portfolio.

Market forces may induce change.

United Arab Emirates is diversifying with renewables and nuclear (for which Russia is a leader in exports).


### The Gravity of Glasgow

#### John Kerry

> The reality today is that if we do not reduce emissions between 2020 and 2030, we cannot hold an increase of 1.5 C. 

At the Leaders Summit on Climate US announced its nationally determined contribution, a 50 to 52% reduction between now and 2030.

> Nations representing 55% of global gross domestic product are now committed to 1.5 degrees. [...]. [Other 45% includes] India, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, and Indonesia.

> The developed world will need to help the developing world. As of yet, there isn't a sufficient plan on the table to do that.

### My First Climate Fight

Gore lost to Bush by 537 votes, the fight against climate change lost 20 years.

2008 AB32 law implemented a cap and trade system in California. Around half the proceeds we put to reducing air pollution and funding housing retrofits in poor communities. It has reduced carbon emissions by 15%. California outpaced the nation in economic growth.

In 2009 the Waxman-Markey climate change bill for a national price on carbon was pushed, the Democrats had the majority in the House of Representatives (219 to 212). The bill died in the Senate. In 2010, the Democrats lost control of Congress and there hasn't been a major climate change bill.

#### Consistent Rules for Public Policy

- Go for the gigatons
- Find out how —and where— decisions are made
  - Legislation is one piece of the puzzle
  - Building code are set by cities
  - Public utility commissions
  - > Are there movements to leverage? Could a massive public rally carry the day? Or might the balance be swung by a pointed economic analysis, or getting the right person elected? Is there a legal angle? How can issued of equity, jobs, and health be driven home?
  - Civic involvement at the local level
- Focus on real-life benefits
  - "People don't know about kilowatt hours, but people care about affordable, reliable, safe, and clean energy."
  - Jobs, the economy and health
- Fight for equity
  - Eisenhower's Intestate Highway System in 1950s, poor black neighborhoods were negatively impacted
  - Climate crisis is impacting the least responsible for it

### Models Matter

> Shouldn't every policy be scored for its climate impact?

#### Megan Mahajan & Robbie Orvis

Emissions are rooted on the physical world.

> There are rigorous model that take technology choices as input. [...]. The simulator takes policy as the input and estimates how any modeled scenario affects emissions, costs, jobs, and health outcomes.

The model is open source and you can check the data and assumptions https://energypolicy.solutions.

> Ultimately, what the model highlights is that a small number of big policies will make a huge difference.

### The Powers Behind the Politics

> I can attest that good policy must run a political gauntlet to get passed.

Historically, fossil fuel interests have been successful in US politics. Public interests groups have documented disinformation campaigns by ExxonMobil and the Koch family.

1992 80% of americans agreed something must be done about climate change. By 2008, the Gallop poll found polarization. In 2010, 48% believed the threat was exaggerated. In 2020, 2/3 of republicans 18-39 years old agreed that climate change is driven by human activity and the government is doing too little about it.

One strong political selling is the jobs that a net-zero transition will bring.
