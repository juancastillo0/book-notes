# Part II: Accelerate the Transition

# Chapter 7: Win politics and Policy

Nuclear is not mentioned in this politics and policy section book.

A carbon price is the policy that matters most.

1992 conference in rio was the first global event where global warming was the main issue. 1994 rich nations should cut emission and subsidize poorer nations. 1997 (Kyoto) conference first emission reduction target (US senate did not ratify the agreement). All were not successful and for almost two decades climate action in politics stalled, until 2015 (Paris) agreement to stay "well below" 2 C.

## The Policies We Need (Key Results)

By country for the top five global emitters.

- 7.1 Commitments: net-zero 2050, 50% by 2030.
  - 7.1.1 Electricity: 50% by 2025, 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, 100% by 2040.
    - Utilities and infrastructure.
  - 7.1.2 Transportation: Freight ships by 2030. Cars, buses and trucks by 2035. Semi trucks by 2045. 40% flights by 2040.
    - Tax credits and rebates. Pay for old cars. Import duties.
  - 7.1.3 Buildings: Zero-emission residential building standards by 2025, commercial by 2030 and prohibit sales of nonelectric equipment by 2030.
    - Furnaces and stoves to electric. Efficiency and insulation. 
    - Example: California's green building codes
  - 7.1.4 Industry: 50% by 2040, 100% by 2050.
  - 7.1.5 Carbon Labeling: Emission footprint label on all goods.
  - 7.1.6 Leaks: Flaring, venting, methane leaks.
- 7.2 Subsidies: End fossil flue subsidies and for harmful agricultural practices.
  - $296 billion annular direct, $5.2 trillion indirect subsidies (6.5% global GDP. Includes health-care costs from air pollution)
- 7.3 Price on Carbon: Minimum $55 pre ton, rising 5% annually.
- 7.4 Global Bans: HFCs refrigerants and single use plastics for non medical uses.
  - Kigali Amendment to phase ot HFCs (China, USA and India still have not joined)
- 7.5 Government R&D: Double investment


## We'll Always Have Paris

It was thought a price on carbon for Glasgow november 2021 might be achievable.

### Cristiana Figueres

> nationally determined contributions. [...]. As long as we are at net zero globally by 2050, each country can determine its own path

Every five years, countries must report on progress. About 60 countries have a price on carbon, but it's low (usually $2-$10 per ton).

> We haven't really incorporated how we'll regenerate soils or reforest degraded lands or protect standing forests.


## Focusing on the Big Five

### Current emissions

- China 26%
- United States 13%
- European Union and United Kingdom 9%
- India 7%
- Russia 5%
- Rest of the world 35%

![](assets/speed_and_scale/current_emissions.svg)

See https://speedandscale.com for more information and progress for each country.

### A Sea Change in China

In 2006 China surpassed USA in emissions. China has also invested in more clean energy than any other country. Has a goal of net-zero by 2060. In 2020 accounted for 50% of new renewal generation capacity.

Coal is the biggest problem. 50% of the world's coal is burnt in China and powers 60% of China's electricity. Limit consumption by 2025 and phase-out between 2026 and 2030. First 6 months of consumption in 2020 China issued more permits than for 2018 and 2019 combined. China also finances other countries' fossil fuel projects.

> When you first start, it's just a job. But after some time, when you see the impact you could bring to the country, the people, and the world, it is no longer just a job. It has become a cause, a higher calling. 
> 
> \- Xie Zhenhue, head of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Tsinghua University.

An estimated 49,000 people died in in Beijing and Shanghai in the first half of 2020. Record floods afflicted 70 million and accounted for $33 billion in losses.

### The United States: Back in Business

Largest cumulative emitter with more than 400 gigatons.

Obama's progress in Clean Air Act (fuel efficiency) and investment in clean energy was reversed by Donald Trump. Biden put forward a climate plan with commitments to 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero by 2050. However, some actions require the support form other parts of government.

US investment in energy has when below 1980 level of $8 billion per year (adjusted for inflation). Less than what Americans spend in a week in gasoline.

### Europe: Leading, but Not Fast Enough

Almost two decades ago the EU implemented a cap-and-trade system.

2019 U.K. legislates net-zero by 2050. 2020 EU did the same and a minimum reduction of 55% by 2030.

Berlin pledged carbon neutrality by 2045. German companies are leading clean hydrogen fuel production for cement and steel. However, Germany should accelerate it's coal phaseout to meet its 2030 target.

### India: The Challenge of Growth

Tropical cyclones, rising sea levels and killer droughts have all intensified in the Indian subcontinent.

India has promised to keep it's emissions per capita below developed nations, but its population will rise by 20% to 1.6 billion by 2050. Coupled with a poverty rate of 60% makes a net-zero goal challenging. "India has been consistent for years in saying they would get to net zero through sectoral targets while protecting their biodiversity. And they are meeting their own Paris targets, sector by sector."

Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, has announced an effort to reach 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. This will require and investment of at least $20 billion per year.

#### Cumulative emissions

- United States 25%
- Europe 22%
- China 13%
- Russia 6%
- Japan 4%
- India 3%
- Rest of the world 25%

![](assets/speed_and_scale/cumulative_emissions.svg)

India's per capita emissions are less than half the global average, it is the globe's 3th energy consumer and 4th emitter. Adding the equivalent of Los Angeles' population every year.


### Will Russia Rise to the Challenge?

2.5 gigatons in 2019.

For some it is the main example of why we will not solve climate change. Low commitment and modest short term targets. Putin has swinged from objecting the science to saying that it will be beneficial for some parts of Russia.

> Russia's Energy Strategy 2035 is a big step backward. It calls for boosting oil and gas production while expanding petroleum exports. Solar and wind have no place in the portfolio.

Market forces may induce change.

United Arab Emirates is diversifying with renewables and nuclear (for which Russia is a leader in exports).


### The Gravity of Glasgow

#### John Kerry

> The reality today is that if we do not reduce emissions between 2020 and 2030, we cannot hold an increase of 1.5 C. 

At the Leaders Summit on Climate US announced its nationally determined contribution, a 50 to 52% reduction between now and 2030.

> Nations representing 55% of global gross domestic product are now committed to 1.5 degrees. [...]. [Other 45% includes] India, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, and Indonesia.

> The developed world will need to help the developing world. As of yet, there isn't a sufficient plan on the table to do that.

### My First Climate Fight

Gore lost to Bush by 537 votes, the fight against climate change lost 20 years.

2008 AB32 law implemented a cap and trade system in California. Around half the proceeds we put to reducing air pollution and funding housing retrofits in poor communities. It has reduced carbon emissions by 15%. California outpaced the nation in economic growth.

In 2009 the Waxman-Markey climate change bill for a national price on carbon was pushed, the Democrats had the majority in the House of Representatives (219 to 212). The bill died in the Senate. In 2010, the Democrats lost control of Congress and there hasn't been a major climate change bill.

#### Consistent Rules for Public Policy

- Go for the gigatons
- Find out how —and where— decisions are made
  - Legislation is one piece of the puzzle
  - Building code are set by cities
  - Public utility commissions
  - > Are there movements to leverage? Could a massive public rally carry the day? Or might the balance be swung by a pointed economic analysis, or getting the right person elected? Is there a legal angle? How can issued of equity, jobs, and health be driven home?
  - Civic involvement at the local level
- Focus on real-life benefits
  - "People don't know about kilowatt hours, but people care about affordable, reliable, safe, and clean energy."
  - Jobs, the economy and health
- Fight for equity
  - Eisenhower's Intestate Highway System in 1950s, poor black neighborhoods were negatively impacted
  - Climate crisis is impacting the least responsible for it

### Models Matter

> Shouldn't every policy be scored for its climate impact?

#### Megan Mahajan & Robbie Orvis

Emissions are rooted on the physical world.

> There are rigorous model that take technology choices as input. [...]. The simulator takes policy as the input and estimates how any modeled scenario affects emissions, costs, jobs, and health outcomes.

The model is open source and you can check the data and assumptions https://energypolicy.solutions.

> Ultimately, what the model highlights is that a small number of big policies will make a huge difference.

### The Powers Behind the Politics

> I can attest that good policy must run a political gauntlet to get passed.

Historically, fossil fuel interests have been successful in US politics. Public interests groups have documented disinformation campaigns by ExxonMobil and the Koch family.

1992 80% of americans agreed something must be done about climate change. By 2008, the Gallop poll found polarization. In 2010, 48% believed the threat was exaggerated. In 2020, 2/3 of republicans 18-39 years old agreed that climate change is driven by human activity and the government is doing too little about it.

One strong political selling is the jobs that a net-zero transition will bring.

# Chapter 8: Turn Movements into Action

Greta Thunberg started with a small school strike in Sweden now her ideas have been heard in multiple conference and was named Time magazine's person of the year in 2019.

> Leaders respond to pressure. Pressure is created by movements.

## What Makes a Movement Matter?

> Movements drive saliency. But to succeed, they need to wield two kinds of power.
> - People power: A broad base of supporters with a narrower group of activist leaders and participants
> - Political power: Allies in public office are enlisted to introduce, champion and defend legislation
> 
> In any case, movements give policy makers cover for political courage.

According to a Harvard study, between 1900 and 2006, every political movement that gained the active and sustained participation of at least 3.5% of the population ended up succeeding.

We must also insist on fairness. The climate crisis is specially devastating to poor communities.

## Turn Movements into Action Key Results

- 8.1 Voters: Climate crisis is a top two voting issue in the 20 most emitting countries by 2025.
  - Regularly takes a back seat to immigration, taxes, and health care.
  - In US 2020, only 3% of voters ranked climate as top priority. Behind COVID, economy, poor leadership, race relations.
  - In 2018 EU 7th behind immigration, terrorism, economy, public finances, unemployment, and EU's influence in the world. In 2019 the issue leaped to number two.
  - In China, people's immediate concern is air pollution. In 2017 a national survey, 90% supported the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
  - In India, top concerns are support for farmers, rural poverty, unemployment and water crisis. All of which will be aggravated by climate change. There have been young-led protests, however it is still not one of the most salient issues.
  - In Russia, public interest have been increasing slowly. In 2019, 10% perceived it as a major concern. The issue ranked 15th behind corruption, high prices and poverty.
- 8.2 Government: A majority of government officials will support the drive for cero.
- 8.3 Business: 100% of fortune 500 commit to reach net zero by 2040.
  - 8.3.1 Transparency: 100% of these publish reports of their emissions by 2022
  - 8.3.2 Operations: 100% reach net zero in their operations (electricity, vehicles, and buildings) by 2030.
- 8.4 Education Equity: The world achieves universal primary and secondary education by 2040
- 8.5 Health Equity: Eliminate the gaps among racial and socio-economic groups in greenhouse gas-related mortality rates by 2040.
- 8.6 Economic Equity: THe clean energy transition creates 65 million new jobs, equitably distributed and outpacing the loss of fossil-fuel jobs.


## Catalyzing Debate and Action: The Impact of the Sunrise Movement

What does it take for a movement to succeed?

> We didn't just deliver a petition with a bunch of numbers about parts per million or 2 C. We shared stories about what we had lost because of the climate crisis, or what we were afraid of losing.
> 
> - Varshini Prakash

Green New Deal brought disagreement inside the Democratic party, but the movement managed to reduce opposition and find a point of unity: 100% clean electricity.

As CNN noted, the organization was striving to "keep one foot inside the halls of power, and another with its activist ranks on the streets."

### Lessons from Beyond Coal

Sierra Club founded by Naturalist John Muir in 1892, was formed to protect forests and other wildlands.

#### Bruce Nilles

Beyond Coal has managed to implement top-down leadership and bottom-up grassroots campaigns to keep coal plants from being built and retiring old ones.

C40 Climate Leadership Group of mayor cities with Michael Bloomberg and Arnold Schwarzeneger to take climate leadership from mayors.

> Clean electricity makes everything else possible. Now our focus is on what's happening with building codes.

## The Corporate Transformation Movement

An often cited Guardian report says that 100 companies account for 71% of GHG emissions. Of course, it is more driven by demand than production, but companies can still make a difference.

Walmart solar power and efficiency. They signed, along with 154 others, the American Business Act on Climate, a pledge to uphold the Paris agreement.

Apple is carbon neutral in its operations, Google has bought renewable energy.

> When corporations make pro-climate commitments, suppliers tend to fall in line.

Changing missions and purposes for corporations from serving shareholders to diversity, sustainability and serving costumers. 

At Amazon, net-zero target conversations started in 2016. The sustainability team has grown from 50 to hundreds. In 2019 Jeff Bezos put forward a plan to reach net-zero by 2019.

### Jeff Bezos

Net-zero is hard for Amazon because of transportation of physical goods.

Founded "Climate Pledge", companies should commit to net-zero by 2040. More than 100 signatory companies (1.4 trillion revenue 5 million employees).
- Colgate-Palmolive: steep plastic and water reduction and recyclable toothpaste tubes
- PepsiCo: Menu of clean energy solutions and regenerative farming mandates in 60 countries by 2030

"Self-reporting is a mechanism to share learnings." - Kara Hurst, Amazon's head of worldwide sustainability

### How Walmart Leads and Doug McMillon

When hurricane Katrina hit, Walmart mobilized it's operation to help with anything they could. 

> What would if take for us to be that company and feel that way every day
> - Lee Scott, CEO of Walmart at the time of Katrina

Social and sustainability goals were set. 

Between 8-10% of emission were from their own operations the other 90-92% where from supply chain.

> We are also going to protect at least 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean
> - Doug McMillon

---

> As Walmart has found, a multi-stakeholder approach, over time, is the best way —perhaps the only way— to maximize value for those that own the business.

### The Risk of Not Joining the Business Movement

> According to BlackRock, a "climate-aware portfolio" is no longer a choice —it's an imperative

#### Larry Fink

Five years ago he started writing letters in support of the corporate sustainability movement. They received  negative responses from environmentalist asking for more and right-wing media outlets criticizing. 

> I came to see more clearly that climate risk is investment risk

In 2020 there was an acceleration in climate-aware investing and more so in 2021.

> We can show the California Public Employees' Retirement System that an investment fund with higher sustainability scores than the S&P 500 Index can also perform better than the Index

Price-to-earnings ratio are typically higher for clean-tech (26-36 to 6-10 for hydrocarbon companies), for example Tesla.

---

ExxonMobil's market value topped at $500 billion in 2007. By 2020, it's value was $175 billion. In the past decade, the total return has dropped by 20%, compared to 277% for the S&P 500 Index. 

Investors, activists and in court (Netherlands with Royal Dutch Shell) have asked companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energies.

## The Move Toward Environmental Justice

### Margot Brown

> I use a systems approach. That means reconciling nature-focused solutions and environmental justice by making health and welfare of humans a critical part of the evaluation.

> More than any other factor, where you live determines the quantity and quality of education you'll receive, the income you'll earn, the health you'll enjoy, and the number of years you can expect to live.

### Closing the Education Gap

> Each additional year of secondary school increases a girl's future earnings by 15-25%. Better-educated women marry later in life and have fewer, healthier children.

> In 2021, at least 4 million girls in low- and middle-income countries will be unable to complete their eduction due to climate-related events: drought, food and water scarcity, displacement. By 2025 it's projected to grow to 12.5 million.

130 million girls do not go to school.

#### Safeena Husain

Identifying the locations with most out of school girls. 

We address some of the hygiene barriers that cause the girls to drop out, like the lack of clean drinking water or a separate toilet.

Parents are often illiterate.

The plan is to enroll 1.5 million girls. Stating with 50 schools, we have doubled in size every 18 months.

> In South Asia, the biggest obstacle to getting girls into school are people's mindsets and traditional and discriminatory social practices.

The challenge is to sustain the campaigns over time. In 6-8 years we cover 10 cohorts of students, a generation. "An educated mother is more than twice as likely to educate her children".

### Closing the Health Gap

Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5 (microns), cause 1 of 5 premature deaths worldwide. 

> In 2019, in India alone, toxic air killed more than 1.6 million people. In US, it leads to 350,000 premature deaths per year. [...]. The black community has more than 50% more exposure to Pm 2.5 than the overall population.

### Widening Opportunity

> Of all the potential benefits of pursuing a net-zero world, job creation might draw the most attention in the political world.

Disadvantaged communities must be prioritized. As the Climate Justice Alliance wrote, "A transition is inevitable. Justice is not".

### A Megaphone for Movements

Before a public gather was required, now, with social media every movement can be travel at digital speeds.

Countdown is a TED-created platform to champion and accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. In 2020, the inaugural event was broadcast though YouTube to 7 million live viewers.

> Local leaders and experts gain access to audiences near and far. Lessons and solutions can be gleaned and streamed to all corners of the world.

> There is no rehearsal. The time is\
> Now\
> Now\
> Now,\
> Because the reversal of harm\
> And protection of a future so universal\
> Should be anything but controversial.\
> So, earth, pale blue dot\
> We will fail you not.
> - Earthrise from Amanda Gorman

# Chapter 9: Innovate!

1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite. In response, president Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). ARPANET, the precursor for the internet was created in 1960. The Apollo missions couldn't have happened without DARPA's breakthroughs in transistor-based electronics. GPS also came form DARPA. First graphical user interface and the mouse.

In 2007 ARPA-E (energy) was founded. However, the total public investment in energy R&D was lower than that in the 1980s.

In 2009, Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in which $25 billion was appropriated for energy R&D, efficiency programs and loan guarantees. $400 million to ARPA-E.

### Eric Toone

They backed 37 projects from renewable energy to building efficiency to bioengineering.

> We realized that what mattered most was whether those innovations could scale up to make a difference in the big energy picture.

> Energy technology has mass which means it doesn't scale like Google or Facebook.

---

Bill Gates gave a TED talk in 2010 about climate change. He realized that energy poverty is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity. In 2015, he proposed a "breakthrough energy effort", a private ARPA-E. The have committed $2 billon, more than 4 times ARPA-E's peak annual budget.

> To make the short list for investment, a venture must show the potential to reduce greenhouse gases by at least half a gigaton per year, or about 1% annual global emissions.

## Innovate! Key Results

- 9.1 Batteries: Produce 10,000 GWh yearly at less the $80 per kWh by 2035
  - Current is $139
  - Transitioning to all new auto sales electric (60 million a year) requires 10,000 GWh. Current is a fraction of that, and we will need more if we want grid storage
- 9.2 Electricity: Cost of zero-emissions baseload power $0.02 per kWh, peak $0.08 by 2030
  - The challenge is to provide steady power all the time and ramp up generation during winter storms or summer heat waves
  - Beat the cost of fossil fuels
- 9.3 Green Hydrogen: $2.0 per ton by 2030 to $1.0 by 2040
  - Can be used for industrial applications that require extreme heat: steel, cement, chemicals
- 9.4 Carbon Removal: $100.0 per ton by 2030 to $50.0 by 2040
  - Storage is hard
  - "If you got it down to $25, it would be one of the largest single contributions to solving climate change that we have ever seen" - Bill Gates
- 9.5 Carbon-Neutral Fuels: $2.5 per gallon for jet fuel and $3.5 for gasoline by 2035
  - Fleets that cannot run on batteries or hydrogen

#### Bill Gates

> We could be looking at extinction as a species

In the physical economy things take time and are hard to change. Electric vehicles account for only 4% of new sales.

The developing world will be the most impacted and the least equipped to make the changes the world needs. Dramatic innovation is needed.

> If you want middle-income countries to go green, the sum of the green premiums across all sectors has to be brought down over 90%.

---

> We also call for innovation that relies less on new choices by society.

### In Pursuit of Battery Breakthroughs

Since 1800, Lord Alessandro Volta unveiled the first battery.

Over the past 20 years the energy density has tripled.

#### Jagdeep Singh

> It was obvious that the only way fro more people to experience EVs would be a drastic drop in the cost of batteries and an equally dramatic increase in the energy density.

He needed the experience from previous startups to start QuantumScape. It's too big and hard.

> If you have a mission beyond just making money, you can retain your people.

Volkswagen invested $300 million and became their largest share holder.

---

In 2018 Volkswagen and QuantumScape created a joint venture for mass production. In 2020, they invested another $200 million.

The key result, 10,000 GWh annually, is close to 20 times the current capacity.

Teslas's Gigafactory is the world's larges building by footprint (> 100 US football fields) and produce just 35 GWh. 

Materials and mining are a concern. 60% of cobalt, which makes up to 20% of a lithium-ion cathode battery's materials, comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Lithium-ion batteries last around 15 years, recycling and waste management need to be sorted out.

In 2017, Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel began recycling used batteries through his new startup, Redwood Materials. Using a closed-loop supply chain.


### Longer Storage for the Winter

In 2021 Texas temperatures dropped to single digits, electricity demand increased and energy infrastructure froze. Over 150 people died.

1 GW of storage in 2015 to 10GW in 2021.

For short cycle energy storage the most popular is lithium-ion.

Currently, for long cycle, the most popular is pumped hydro. However, it's costly to build and won't work on leveled land.

Other alternatives include (and companies):
- Gravitational energy with solid blocks (Energy Vault)
- Heat in molten salt (Malta)
- Pressurized air (Highview Power and Hydrostor)
- Green hydrogen (Bloom Energy)
- Chemical reactions (Form Energy)

### Next-Generation Nuclear Fission

In all of the technology's history (18,500 reactor-years) three accident have happened: Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011).

More regulations makes them more costly to build and operate.

Technology improvements could be implemented for costs, scalability, applicability, safety and efficiency. Typically called Generation IV reactors.

> It's the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver power day and night, thorough every season, almost anywhere on earth, that has been proven to work on a larger scale.
> - Bill Gates

In June 2021 TerraPower announced plans to build a plant in Wyoming.

TerraPower's main goals are:
- Safety
- Non-proliferation
- Waste
- Cost

### The Fusion Moonshot

Fusion is the union of small nuclei (hydrogen) while fission splits big nuclei (uranium, plutonium, ...).

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an MIT spinoff is building superconducting magnets for small tokamak devices.

### Carbon-Neutral Fuels

> It's almost certain that long-haul ships and planes will continue to burn liquid fuels for some time to come.

if we use biomass, we must keep land use and carbon emissions of the entire process (typically a 30-80% reduction) in mind.

> One acre of solar panels produce as much energy as a hundred acres of sugarcane.

Synthetic fuels would need a very low cost source of energy or a high carbon price to compete with fossil fuels.

### Energy Efficiency Breakthroughs

Light weight materials in vehicles. From steel to aluminum (F-150) or carbon fiber (BMW i3 EV).

More efficient electric motor control (switched reluctance motor).

### Engineering Our Climate

We might try to alter the climate.

The first known seawall was erected 7000 years ago in the northern coast of Israel. However, geoengineering is not about adapting but changing the climate itself.

One alternative is with sulfur dioxide particles in the atmosphere that reflect incoming sunlight. Volcanic eruptions have shown that sulfur can reduce incoming radiation and, therefore, temperature.

> Al Gore would say that geoengineering is less a moonshot solution than a Faustian bargain with nature.

Elizabeth Kolbert's "Under a White Sky" discusses some of the impacts of humanity's nature transformations.

### Constructing and Reconstructing Cities

In 2000, 371 cities had more than 1 million inhabitants. In 2021, there are 540. In 2030, there will be 700.

> China pours more cement in two years than US in the 20th century.

#### How Will We Design and Construct Our Buildings?

Airflow management to reduce heating and cooling energy needs. Stores, jobs and apartments close enough to walk. Parks and trees to capture CO2. Rain water use and waste water recycling.

> We've had these solutions for decades; the innovation lies in their integration into a single coherent plan.

#### How Will People Get Around?

Bicycling, public transport and reduce cars.

Copenhagen, the world's leading bike commuter city.

Denmark contains 237 miles of wide dedicated bike lanes. Most of them are elevated and buffered by curbs from car traffic. In 2019, more then 60% of commuters used bikes, up from 36% in 2012.

> Where urban biking is less popular, surveys say, it's for a lack of protected bike lanes.

Barcelona famous for it's car-free zones. Its "Superblock" model has been copied around the world. Bans on old vehicles has been implemented with an increased funding in public transit.

#### How Much Green Cover Can We Retain?

Singapore mandates plants around buildings with metric of the ratio of greens to urbana rea.

> Ground-level greenery reduces peak surface temperatures between 2 and 9 C. Green roods and walls even mote 17 C. They also act as thermal insulation for the buildings themselves.

New York hay applied all three. High Line park. Increase in car-free zones. 17% bus rideship increase in a year. Between 2005 and 2016, 15% reduction in CO2 emissions.

### Scaling Up R&D Itself

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it" - Alan Kay, Apple's first chief scientist.

> The second best way is to fund it.

# Chapter 10: Invest!

In 2006 Kleiner Perkings invested $350 million in solar, EVs and biodiesel that did not pan out. "zigs and zags are part of the territory".

Wired and Fortune published stories about the bad results in cleantech investing. However, multiple companies such as Beyond Meat (Meat alternatives), Enphase Energy (solar equipment for homeowners) and Proterra (electric buses) have been successful.

> Great ventures are set apart by a handful of factors:
> - technical excellence
> - an outstanding team
> - reasonable financing
> - laser focus—on either large, existing market or a rapidly growing new one
> 
> As well a paradoxical combination of persistence patience and urgency.

Government R&D and financial incentives, venture, philanthropic, and project financing, all are needed at unprecedented speed and scale. "Reaching net zero globally will require as much as $1.7 trillion each year—and we'll need to go full throttle for 20 years or more".


## Invest! Key Results

- 10.1 Financial Incentives: Government subsidies from $128 billion to $600 billion.
  - Eliminate financial subsidies
- 10.2 Government R&D: Increase funding from $7.8 billion to $40 billion in the US. Triple current funding in other countries.
- 10.3 Venture Capital: Investments of capital into private companies from $13.6 billion to $50 billion.
- 10.4 Project financing: Zero-emissions project financing from $300 billion to $1 trillion per year.
  - Proven technologies
  - Banks lend money
- 10.5 Philanthropic Investing: From $10 billion to $30 billion per year.

## Turning Government Incentives Around

Eliminate preferential treatment for the fossil fuel industry.

> If all costs were to be taken into account, from climate change to mortality and disease from air pollution, the sector would owe more than $3 trillion a year.

Invest in solutions that are not widely available due to the financial risk inherent in innovation.

In the federal clean tech loans, the interest rate was pegged for the government to break even. A 4 percent default rate for a portfolio of innovative utility-scale renewable projects would have netted "monstrous profits".

Between 2012 and 2020, China allocated an average of $77 billion per year. In 2010, US was $70 billion. China now owns 70% of the solar manufacturing market.

## The Power of Venture Capital

Over the past 5 years more than $52 billion on global venture capital has been channeled into clean tech.

As of 2007, the VC industry had bankrolled less than $400 million across eighty climate deals. 7 years later, almost $7 billion had been plowed into 400 deals.

The timing was not ideal with the financial crisis in 2008. The implosion was triggered by the fall of oil and gas prices, a resulting credit crunch, and the inability of US companies to keep pace with China's subsidized competition.

Proterra with their electric busses and ChargePoint, which operated America's largest network of public EV charging stations 112,000 locations. Nest was acquired by Google in 2014 and Opower was acquired by Oracle in 2016.

By January 2021, Ethan Brown and Beyond Meat had raised $240 million with a return of 140 times the original investment.

Since 2006, Kleiner has invested $1 billion in 66 clean tech ventures, in 2021 the value of their stake was $3.2 billion.

#### Be ruthless in identifying the key risk up front—and removing it

- Technology risk (it won't work)
- Market risk (it won't stand out)
- Consumer risk (it won't sell well)
- Regulatory risk (it won't get approved)

What are the main risks? Could early-stage capital be used to remove them? If not it will be nearly impossible to raise later-stage capital.

#### You are always raising money

Be great at fundraising.

#### Costs are king; performance matters

When you are competing an a commodities market (electricity, steel, cement), unit costs rule.

#### Own the relationship with your customer

Direct relationship with end buyers

#### Incumbents will fight

### Matt Rogers

Matt Rogers has worked at Apple, Nest and is now created an investment fund called Incite for mission-driven clean tech.

> We had so much brain power, horse power and financial resource going into apps. But what were we putting into climate?

Ww took and analytical approach. We knew the consumer market from Apple, and heating and cooling was at the top, it accounted for half the energy use of homes.

We already had the iPhone 4 and controlled how we spend thousands of dollars a year in heating thought a plastic thing from the 1970s.

---

In january 2021, investment in clean technologies exceeded the total for all 2015.

### Carmichael Roberts

After an investment from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we work to make sure the decision was not crazy. We mine out networks, scour the landscape for partnerships, We provide technical expertise.


## This Is Not a Bubble, It's a Boom

Investment bubbles have founded new industries, from the railroads and automobiles to telecommunications and the internet. With each disruptive technology, mounds of money pour in. Much of it is lost. But society gains.

ChargePoint, QuantumScape and Proterra were all acquired by SPACs (Special purpose acquisition companies). Investor enthusiasm is surging, from 46 SPAC deals in 2018 to 248 in 2020. 20% energy or climate related. Some are warning of a bubble of speculative over-funding.

## A Solar Power Turnaround

### Bradi Kothandaraman

> I started at Enphase in 2017. For the first 2 years, my focus as CEO was on operational excellence. We measured everything. We prices products based on the value they generated compared to the next best alternatives. Bonus based on goals and progress.

We relentlessly focused on quality and gave equal diligence to customer service. 

In 2021, Enphase was deemed big and steady enough to join the ranks of the S&P 500 index.

## Putting Project Financing to Work

Clean energy project financing has soared from 33 to 524 billion in the past 17 years. Mainly solar and wind plants, with growing amounts to electrification of heat and transportation.

The key result is 1 trillion a year. Beyond funding proven technologies, public and private banks need to issue more loans for new energy sources, storage and carbon removal.

Project funders are governments, companies, banks and philanthropists.

## Summoning a New Kind of Capital

Few companies have moved faster than Google in the quest for net zero. In 2007, with purchases of renewable energy and high quality carbon offsets, Google became carbon neutral thought its operations. In 2017 they powered 100% of its operations from renewables.

### Sundar Pichai

Thinking with a multi-decade time frame allows you to take moonshots, to be very ambitious.

Largest sustainability bond in corporate history, 5.75 billion in green project financing.

One such project centers on next-generation geothermal energy. Wind and solar are intermittent. With a plant in Nevada to power Google data centers and use AI to follow demand.

Google maps now defaults to the most eco-friendly route. Focusing on the world's 500 top cities, that account for 50% of the world's population and 70% of emissions. We are working with local leaders to install air quality sensors.

### Kate Brandt

Chief sustainability officer, Google

We are passionate about the role of AI to drive deep energy efficiency gains. Used in data centers, trying to take it to other operators and buildings.

Nest for residential.

## How Money Flows

> We realized poverty and climate change were the same issue, just different sides of the same coin

### David Blood

I wanted to use the capital markets to help address the challenges of sustainable development.

We use environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as tools to evaluate the quality of businesses and management teams.

At Generation we believe that the next decade will be the most important of our careers.

## The Mother of All Markets

Unlike the internet, the clean energy transition will unfold on a local level.

## The Growing Need for Giving

Not all climate solutions will come with 10x return on investment.

Philanthropic giving totaled $730 billion in 2019. Less than 2% as for the climate crisis. Most goes to health care and education.

One front-runner is the IKEA Foundation. IKEA's retail business has pledged to go carbon-negative by 2030.

In February 2020, Jeff Bezos pledge $10 billion for Bezos Earth Fund. Mainly for non-for profit related to protection and preservation of wildlife and ecosystems.

### Jeff Bezos

This is the decisive decade, if we don't make the right kind of progress by 2030, it will be too late.

There is not just one thing, there are a bunch of things, and it's a daunting problem because of its scale.

Philanthropy can get things started, prove out solutions. The Bezos Earth Fund is purely philanthropic. Philanthropy in climate is very small and only growing a couple percent annually.

It's not a one size fits all theory of change. There are multiple problems.
### Andrew Steer

The starting point of the Bezos Earth Fund will be to diagnose the system changes that will be needed this decade.

- Energy
- Transport
- Industry
- Food
- Agriculture
- Financial Systems

We know these changes are economically, financially and socially beneficial. But there are all kinds of barriers, knowledge gaps, risk aversions, and path dependencies that prevent them from happening.

Different transitions are at different stages. Basic research, creating a new market, de-risking investments.

## The Philanthropic Mission. Laurene Powell Jobs

Steve used to say:
> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and to love what you do.

In 2004, I started the Emerson Collective on the belief that all the issues we work on, all the systems that touch our lives on the planet, are interlocking.

Working on education, we supported students through college, but they did not want to come back to East Palo Alto, there were no jobs. You have to address everything.

Philanthropic capital should not be doing what at-scale capital can do. It's at risk capital. We're okay if 30% of our portfolio fails, as long as we fail fast, learn fast, and move fast. If we tell ourselves everything will be successful, we will miss out on a lot.

The degree to which everything needs to change is daunting. It requires all of us.

Working on climate change will bring us back into harmony with the natural world.

### Dawn Lippert

You can't talk about energy for 5 minutes without bumping into issues about water, transportation, education, or the workforce.

We were getting technical results, but not seeing large-scale adoption. We were missing the commercial and community contexts.

Elemental funds youth internships in its portfolio companies and in other climate related opportunities.

The Hawaii state leads the country in residential energy efficiency and clean electricity.

# Conclusion

We'll need more people in motion and more technologies deployed and more new ones invented than at any time in human history.

We must deploy the now with no less vigo than we seek the new.

Clean energy must offer a competitive advantage.

OKRs foster several virtues: focus, alignment, commitment, ambition. But the most important may be tracking, or continuous measurement.

Working against us is the world's steadily growing population. Billions more people will require more resources.

To become a leader in climate you must first figure out *what* to do. Then, you should get other people *want* to do it. Third, move others in your own way.

It's human nature to cling to the life we know. It's not an easy thing to relinquish.
