Specially for tension.

## Impact strength

Speed of sound in materials:

$$ sqrt(E / \rho) $$

Speed of sound (4800 $m/s$ for steel, aluminum, glass) is much faster than any hammer blow or bullets.

Dynamics don't typically matter. Stuff (humen head, tank of liquid, tiles) don't, usually, break at the point of impact. Stress from the waves may pile up at one point.

### Izod test

Energy of fracture by difference in pendulum height.

## Griffith criterion and critical crack

To propagate a crack it must:
1. Be energetically desired
2. Have a molecular mechanism for the energy transformation to take place

Producing by releasing stress and consuming by creating surface (against surface tension $2*G*l$) and moving the material's molecular structure (low in non-crystals).

Releasing energy is proportional to the square of the crack length and the energy consumed is only proportional to the crack length.

### Critical crack length

The fractures is producing more energy than it is consuming.

$$ l_g = 2 * W * E / (pi * s^2) $$

where $W$ is the work of fracture.

The kind energy absorbed during fracture varies by material.


### Stress concentration at the tip of a crack

$$ K = 2 * sqrt(l / R) $$

where $l$ = crack length and $R$ = tip radius. 

R is comparable to atomic dimensions (1 A).

As long as the crack is shorter than the critical length nothing will happen. Thus the safeguard against brittle fracture is a high work of fracture ($W$). 

Glass $W$ is 6 $J/m^2$ (six times $G$). Others between 10^4 and 10^6 $J/m^2$ (ten thousand to a million times $G$). 10^4 timber and 10^5 steel. Glass is brittle and steel is tough (support bigger cracks), but have similar tensile strength (max stress).

Crack speed is ~38% the speed of sound in the material.

Easy propagation of cracks could be an advantage in shaping (for primitive man). Most of the tensile stress in tools are due to bending, making them smaller reduces the stress ($l_g \propto 1/s^2$).


## Non-metals

Masonry attempts to put everything in compression since brittle the tensile stress is what spreads cracks.

Pre-compressing concrete (tensed wires) or the sides prone to cracking in glass (by rapidly cooling the outer surface the glass contracts as it cools).

Cellulose is not weak or brittle yet it's a sugar (glucose molecules). Bones and teeth are also tough.

### The interface as a crack-stopper

Composite materials are tough even do their components could be brittle (glass and resin in fiberglass)

Type of loading (bending, pure tensile) doesn't matter much close to the crack, the stress pattern is similar. 

Toughness can be achieved by increasing work fracture or by stopping cracks from running. (or maybe by increasing the crack's tip radius)

Irrespective of the proportions of the crack or the means by which it is loaded the ratio of the maximum value of this stress parallel to the crack surfaces to the peak opening stress at right angles to the crack is constant and has a value of one to five.

If the adhesive strength of the interface in a composite material is less than 1/5 of the general cohesive strength of the solid then the interface will be broken before the main crack reaches it and a crack trap or crack stopper has been created.

We have weakened the material by a factor of 5, however, the true fracture stress of at the crack tip is, presumably, the theoretical strength of the material and this lies between 10 and 20 percent of the Young's modulus. Reducing it by 1/5 still leaves a potential for 2-4% of $E$. Which is roughly that for fiberglass and more than what is achieved with the metallic ductility mechanism ([Chapter 9](#chapter-9)). Strength greatly in excess of 1% may not be of much interest in practical engineering ([Chapter 8](#chapter-8)).

In teeth, the exterior enamel is 99% (by volume) inorganic separated by an organic protein. The interior dentine is 70% inorganic (with smaller crystals) separated by mostly collagen.

Ivory can become brittle if water in the interface hydroxyls is evaporated.

## Thermoplastics

First was Bakelite made by reacting phenol with formaldehyde, patented in 1906. Thermosetting plastics can be made hard by heating them to temperatures above 150 C. Since they have an irregular 3D structure (similar to glass), they usually have a low work of fracture ($W$), ~100 $J/m^2$. You can typically increase the toughness by including fibers such as in a composite material. 

Thermoplastics solved some issues in 1945. Polymeric chains are not cross-linked (different structure as that of glass). Heating to 100-150 C melts them which is good for manufacturing. Similar molecular bonds as in diamond ($E$ = 1.2 * 10^6 $MN/m^2$ $\rho$ = 3.3 $g/cc$) but much lower for Thermoplastics ($E$ = 2 * 10^4 $MN/m^2$ $\rho$ = 3.0.92 $g/cc$). Work of fracture is at least 100x higher than Thermosetting.

Natural materials develop chains in the direction of the stresses which results in a high Young's modulus. Artificial plastics have the chains "crystallize" in a zig-zag pattern, van der Waal forces are the main contributor to $E$. A lot of energy is expended in unraveling the molecules (high work of fracture).

Wood retains its popularity because of its stiffness and needs to develop another mechanism to fight crack propagation (high toughness).

# Chapter 6: Timber and cellulose

Cellulose is the structural part of all vegetable matter, 1/3 of the weight. Not usually in animals, apart for the marine Tunicates. Chitin in insects is very similar. 

Weight by Weight, the strength of commercial steel and timber are comparable. (The book was published a while ago) Very roughly the price of industrial timber is similar to mild steel. Density of wood averages 1/14 that of steel. 1100 lb steel 700 lb wood per person per year in England and Holland. 1100 lb vs 2400 lb USA. 1100 lb vs 3300 lb Canada.

## Plant growth

Although plants are very different but they all use cellulose. The more advanced plants contain hollow, elongated spindle-shaped cells whose walls are made largely of cellulose. A cellulose chain is several glucose molecules joined together (oxygen linkage). The cells walls are more or less in the direction of the applied stress. In the majority of trees the nes cellulose is laid down in the cell already containing the stresses and strains which it has to bear. The cells in timber are roughly rectangular and the chains are helical with between 6 and 30 degrees.

The cells have weak interfaces which, when separated, are able to operate independently and buckle, which causes the helix to elongate. Buckling and elongation of the cells require a great deal of energy. The arrangement is partly water-proof crystalline (30-40%) and partly amorphous.

Timber, bamboo, cane, flax, hemp, cotton, ramie, sisal, espato are similar in terms of mechanical behavior, swelling in water, and in the relation of temperature and moisture content to strength.

## The properties of wood

Superficial differences apart from the density, primarily caused by various thicknesses of the cell walls. Most of the mechanical properties of timbers are proportional to their densities (roughly).

| Wood           | Density ($lb/ft^3$) |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Seasoned balsa | 5 to 10             |
| Spruce         | 30                  |
| Oak            | 50                  |
| Lignum vitae   | 80                  |

Wood substance is about 60% cellulose, other sugar compounds and lignin, a substance with affinities to a resin. Immediately before failure wood becomes birefringent and easily stained, probably due to the George Jeronimidis' fracture mechanism (Buckling and elongation). This cannot be used as warning. 

Laterally (across the grains) it has a low tensile and compressive strength (~100s $lb/in^2$). Nails and screws of reasonable size do not weaken the wood (you should leave them in), it is resistant to stress concentrations.

Tensile strength of spruce is 120 $MN/m^2$ with 1% elastic strain, between 1/10 and 1/20 of the theoretical strength. Much better than most engineering material. Mild steel 0.15% elastic strain. 

In practice it is not easy to use the high tensile strength, the weakness is in compression along the grain (30 $MN/m^2$, weigh for weight still respectable). In most cases, wood is used in bending and the crushing of the compression side transfers the load into the tension side. Nominal stress on failure may be up to 2 times the true compressive stress. This makes a structure made out of timber a safe one, plus it is also noisy.

Weight for weight the Young's modulus of timbers is almost the same as steel and aluminum, and better tha synthetic resins. The strength, stiffness and low density make them efficient for beams and columns. Furniture, floor, shelves, flagstaffs and yachts' masts.

Timber creeps. If left with a stress it will tend to deform. Probably because the amorphous part moves with changes in temperature and moisture.

## Swellulose

Moisture content of between 22% to 5% depending on the air's relative humidity. It shrinks and swells (1% moisture content corresponds to 0.5% shrinkage or swelling in the cross grain direction). Therefore, 5-10% of changes in lateral dimension could be expected. If it is laterally restrained when shrinking, it will split since it has low tensile strength across the grains. Swelling could provide great stress.

We wood has 1/3 of the strength of dry wood. In nature all wood is saturated. In engineering it is in between.

Bending moist and heated wood is easier. Wood is typically steamed when bent. It will not come to much harm in moist heat below 140 C.

### Seasoning

Removing the moisture content so that it is close to that experienced in practice. You can't season too fast, it might split because of shrinkage. Usage of timber (joined with glue) with smaller size decreases seasoning time. 

Moisture content is measured by weight lost or by the electrical resistance between two needles pressed in the wood.

Up to 25% is held in hydroxyls in the cell walls. After 25% the hydroxyls become saturated (fibre saturation point). The water is positioned in the lumen, the hollow part of the cell. "All the dimensional and mechanical changes in wood which are due to moisture occur below the fiber saturation point".

Wood substance has a specific gravity of around 1.4 but freshly felled timber floats. Wood will eventually become waterlogged and sink. However, there are ships that last upwards of a hundred years.

## Rot

Rot is caused by parasitic fungi in cellulose. Expands after 18% moisture content, however spores can sustain much drier conditions waiting for favorable situations. Ventilation also prevents rot from arising. Chemical treatment can also be used.

## Wooden ships

Made the expansion of western civilization possible. The middle of 19th century saw technical improvements, for the previous 3-4 centuries the methods of construction were mostly the same. Wood swelled and the expense of metals were the main controlling factors.

Design was central to accommodate shrinking and swelling of the planking without leaking. 

In 1830 the introduction of diagonal (shear) iron bracing reduced excessive leakage. Stress in windward direction might be as important as the ship's displacement, there was reluctance to perform long voyages. Wire standing rigging, introduced in 1838, improved creep. Introduction of chain cable vs hemp anchor cables. Copper sheathing (under-water copper lining) in 1770.

"Fall in cost of iron and steel plates in the 1870s made composite shipbuilding uneconomic". The loss of speed of steel vessels from rougher bottom was compensated because they could be sailed harder.

For racing yachts wood still provides the lightest of hulls and cheap to build a one-off design. Leakage in bad weather is still a problem in cheaper models which can be solved with more expensive construction, but then one could build in steel or plastic.
