Specially for tension.

## Impact strength

Speed of sound in materials:

$$ sqrt(E / \rho) $$

Speed of sound (4800 $m/s$ for steel, aluminum, glass) is much faster than any hammer blow or bullets.

Dynamics don't typically matter. Stuff (humen head, tank of liquid, tiles) don't, usually, break at the point of impact. Stress from the waves may pile up at one point.

### Izod test

Energy of fracture by difference in pendulum height.

## Griffith criterion and critical crack

To propagate a crack it must:
1. Be energetically desired
2. Have a molecular mechanism for the energy transformation to take place

Producing by releasing stress and consuming by creating surface (against surface tension $2*G*l$) and moving the material's molecular structure (low in non-crystals).

Releasing energy is proportional to the square of the crack length and the energy consumed is only proportional to the crack length.

### Critical crack length

The fractures is producing more energy than it is consuming.

$$ l_g = 2 * W * E / (pi * s^2) $$

where $W$ is the work of fracture.

The kind energy absorbed during fracture varies by material.


### Stress concentration at the tip of a crack

$$ K = 2 * sqrt(l / R) $$

where $l$ = crack length and $R$ = tip radius. 

R is comparable to atomic dimensions (1 A).

As long as the crack is shorter than the critical length nothing will happen. Thus the safeguard against brittle fracture is a high work of fracture ($W$). 

Glass $W$ is 6 $J/m^2$ (six times $G$). Others between 10^4 and 10^6 $J/m^2$ (ten thousand to a million times $G$). 10^4 timber and 10^5 steel. Glass is brittle and steel is tough (support bigger cracks), but have similar tensile strength (max stress).

Crack speed is ~38% the speed of sound in the material.

Easy propagation of cracks could be an advantage in shaping (for primitive man). Most of the tensile stress in tools are due to bending, making them smaller reduces the stress ($l_g \propto 1/s^2$).


## Non-metals

Masonry attempts to put everything in compression since brittle the tensile stress is what spreads cracks.

Pre-compressing concrete (tensed wires) or the sides prone to cracking in glass (by rapidly cooling the outer surface the glass contracts as it cools).

Cellulose is not weak or brittle yet it's a sugar (glucose molecules). Bones and teeth are also tough.

### The interface as a crack-stopper

Composite materials are tough even do their components could be brittle (glass and resin in fiberglass)

Type of loading (bending, pure tensile) doesn't matter much close to the crack, the stress pattern is similar. 

Toughness can be achieved by increasing work fracture or by stopping cracks from running. (or maybe by increasing the crack's tip radius)

Irrespective of the proportions of the crack or the means by which it is loaded the ratio of the maximum value of this stress parallel to the crack surfaces to the peak opening stress at right angles to the crack is constant and has a value of one to five.

If the adhesive strength of the interface in a composite material is less than 1/5 of the general cohesive strength of the solid then the interface will be broken before the main crack reaches it and a crack trap or crack stopper has been created.

We have weakened the material by a factor of 5, however, the true fracture stress of at the crack tip is, presumably, the theoretical strength of the material and this lies between 10 and 20 percent of the Young's modulus. Reducing it by 1/5 still leaves a potential for 2-4% of $E$. Which is roughly that for fiberglass and more than what is achieved with the metallic ductility mechanism ([Chapter 9](#chapter-9)). Strength greatly in excess of 1% may not be of much interest in practical engineering ([Chapter 8](#chapter-8)).

In teeth, the exterior enamel is 99% (by volume) inorganic separated by an organic protein. The interior dentine is 70% inorganic (with smaller crystals) separated by mostly collagen.

Ivory can become brittle if water in the interface hydroxyls is evaporated.

## Thermoplastics

First was Bakelite made by reacting phenol with formaldehyde, patented in 1906. Thermosetting plastics can be made hard by heating them to temperatures above 150 C. Since they have an irregular 3D structure (similar to glass), they usually have a low work of fracture ($W$), ~100 $J/m^2$. You can typically increase the toughness by including fibers such as in a composite material. 

Thermoplastics solved some issues in 1945. Polymeric chains are not cross-linked (different structure as that of glass). Heating to 100-150 C melts them which is good for manufacturing. Similar molecular bonds as in diamond ($E$ = 1.2 * 10^6 $MN/m^2$ $\rho$ = 3.5 $g/cm^3$) but much lower for thermoplastics ($E$ = 2 * 10^4 $MN/m^2$ $\rho$ = 0.92 $g/cm^3$). Work of fracture is at least 100x higher than Thermosetting.

Natural materials develop chains in the direction of the stresses which results in a high Young's modulus. Artificial plastics have the chains "crystallize" in a zig-zag pattern, van der Waal forces are the main contributor to $E$. A lot of energy is expended in unraveling the molecules (high work of fracture).

Wood retains its popularity because of its stiffness and needs to develop another mechanism to fight crack propagation (high toughness).

# Chapter 6: Timber and cellulose

Cellulose is the structural part of all vegetable matter, 1/3 of the weight. Not usually in animals, apart for the marine Tunicates. Chitin in insects is very similar. 

Weight by Weight, the strength of commercial steel and timber are comparable. (The book was published a while ago) Very roughly the price of industrial timber is similar to mild steel. Density of wood averages 1/14 that of steel. 1100 lb steel 700 lb wood per person per year in England and Holland. 1100 lb vs 2400 lb USA. 1100 lb vs 3300 lb Canada.

## Plant growth

Although plants are very different but they all use cellulose. The more advanced plants contain hollow, elongated spindle-shaped cells whose walls are made largely of cellulose. A cellulose chain is several glucose molecules joined together (oxygen linkage). The cells walls are more or less in the direction of the applied stress. In the majority of trees the nes cellulose is laid down in the cell already containing the stresses and strains which it has to bear. The cells in timber are roughly rectangular and the chains are helical with between 6 and 30 degrees.

The cells have weak interfaces which, when separated, are able to operate independently and buckle, which causes the helix to elongate. Buckling and elongation of the cells require a great deal of energy. The arrangement is partly water-proof crystalline (30-40%) and partly amorphous.

Timber, bamboo, cane, flax, hemp, cotton, ramie, sisal, espato are similar in terms of mechanical behavior, swelling in water, and in the relation of temperature and moisture content to strength.

## The properties of wood

Superficial differences apart from the density, primarily caused by various thicknesses of the cell walls. Most of the mechanical properties of timbers are proportional to their densities (roughly).

| Wood           | Density ($lb/ft^3$) |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Seasoned balsa | 5 to 10             |
| Spruce         | 30                  |
| Oak            | 50                  |
| Lignum vitae   | 80                  |

Wood substance is about 60% cellulose, other sugar compounds and lignin, a substance with affinities to a resin. Immediately before failure wood becomes birefringent and easily stained, probably due to the George Jeronimidis' fracture mechanism (Buckling and elongation). This cannot be used as warning. 

Laterally (across the grains) it has a low tensile and compressive strength (~100s $lb/in^2$). Nails and screws of reasonable size do not weaken the wood (you should leave them in), it is resistant to stress concentrations.

Tensile strength of spruce is 120 $MN/m^2$ with 1% elastic strain, between 1/10 and 1/20 of the theoretical strength. Much better than most engineering material. Mild steel 0.15% elastic strain. 

In practice it is not easy to use the high tensile strength, the weakness is in compression along the grain (30 $MN/m^2$, weigh for weight still respectable). In most cases, wood is used in bending and the crushing of the compression side transfers the load into the tension side. Nominal stress on failure may be up to 2 times the true compressive stress. This makes a structure made out of timber a safe one, plus it is also noisy.

Weight for weight the Young's modulus of timbers is almost the same as steel and aluminum, and better tha synthetic resins. The strength, stiffness and low density make them efficient for beams and columns. Furniture, floor, shelves, flagstaffs and yachts' masts.

Timber creeps. If left with a stress it will tend to deform. Probably because the amorphous part moves with changes in temperature and moisture.

## Swellulose

Moisture content of between 22% to 5% depending on the air's relative humidity. It shrinks and swells (1% moisture content corresponds to 0.5% shrinkage or swelling in the cross grain direction). Therefore, 5-10% of changes in lateral dimension could be expected. If it is laterally restrained when shrinking, it will split since it has low tensile strength across the grains. Swelling could provide great stress.

We wood has 1/3 of the strength of dry wood. In nature all wood is saturated. In engineering it is in between.

Bending moist and heated wood is easier. Wood is typically steamed when bent. It will not come to much harm in moist heat below 140 C.

### Seasoning

Removing the moisture content so that it is close to that experienced in practice. You can't season too fast, it might split because of shrinkage. Usage of timber (joined with glue) with smaller size decreases seasoning time. 

Moisture content is measured by weight lost or by the electrical resistance between two needles pressed in the wood.

Up to 25% is held in hydroxyls in the cell walls. After 25% the hydroxyls become saturated (fibre saturation point). The water is positioned in the lumen, the hollow part of the cell. "All the dimensional and mechanical changes in wood which are due to moisture occur below the fiber saturation point".

Wood substance has a specific gravity of around 1.4 but freshly felled timber floats. Wood will eventually become waterlogged and sink. However, there are ships that last upwards of a hundred years.

## Rot

Rot is caused by parasitic fungi in cellulose. Expands after 18% moisture content, however spores can sustain much drier conditions waiting for favorable situations. Ventilation also prevents rot from arising. Chemical treatment can also be used.

## Wooden ships

Made the expansion of western civilization possible. The middle of 19th century saw technical improvements, for the previous 3-4 centuries the methods of construction were mostly the same. Wood swelled and the expense of metals were the main controlling factors.

Design was central to accommodate shrinking and swelling of the planking without leaking. 

In 1830 the introduction of diagonal (shear) iron bracing reduced excessive leakage. Stress in windward direction might be as important as the ship's displacement, there was reluctance to perform long voyages. Wire standing rigging, introduced in 1838, improved creep. Introduction of chain cable vs hemp anchor cables. Copper sheathing (under-water copper lining) in 1770.

"Fall in cost of iron and steel plates in the 1870s made composite shipbuilding uneconomic". The loss of speed of steel vessels from rougher bottom was compensated because they could be sailed harder.

For racing yachts wood still provides the lightest of hulls and cheap to build a one-off design. Leakage in bad weather is still a problem in cheaper models which can be solved with more expensive construction, but then one could build in steel or plastic.

# Chapter 7: Glue and plywood - or mice in the gliders

Until recently the strength of joints between components was so inefficient that the strength of materials was scarcely used. Knots and slices in rope are 40-80% efficient. Nailed, bolted, screwed pegged or dovetailed joints in wood are far less efficient. 

> Mechanical connections of all kinds have been driven out by modern glues which have made the efficient use of wood possible but have introduced problems of their own.

## Glue

Wetting a solid with a liquid reduces the surface energy since the energy at the interface will be less than the sum of the energies in contact with the air. A hardened liquid will require strain energy to be removed while maintaining the reduced surface energy.

Gelatine glue for indoors (melts 80 C and dissolves in water). Hide glue (only used for small pieces) in fishing rods with soaking in formalin for water-proof. 

Casein was used in Egypt then in 1800 in Germany and Switzerland. Not introduced into engineering until its use in aircraft and yacht around 1930 (made them practicable). Casein is the whey in milk, not soluble in acid (weak hydrochloric acid). Reacts with lime to produce an insoluble chemical, calcium caseinate. Sold in a package with dried whey, caustic soda and lime. With water it dissolves with the caustic soda and slowly solidifies when reacting with lime. Calcium caseinate softens when soaked. Tests on wet and dry airplanes resulted in similar strength.

Virtually the whole load is carried in the extreme ends or edges of the joint. A variant of stress concentration. The strength of the joint depends on the width, not on the area (similar to first and last bolts or rivets). Dry casein behaves brittle and Hookean, and experiences high stress at the edges which results in cracks. Wet casein is not Hookean and the concentration of stress is distributed. The effects cancel out. Under prolonged moist conditions it will behave as cheese and rot.

Synthetic phenol-formaldehyde or "Bakelite" solidifies with heat (150 C) and pressure in a hydraulic press. For these conditions, it was only useful for plywood. Can be set with strong catalysts.

Urea-formaldehyde can be set with much weaker catalysts. Problems with the setting and application were mitigated by requiring separate parts for the setting to begin and the use of dyes to reduce human error.

These is what be had by the end of the war. More recent developments include resorcinol formaldehyde and epoxy resins.

Typical failures exhibit a thin layer of wood covering the glued surface.

## Laminated wood and plywood

Most engineering used of wood are laminated joined with pressure and glue. Defects can be detected, all wood can be used and the appropriate sizes can be obtained.

"Improved wood" is compressed wood which increased mechanical properties, but only in proportion to density, it made it brittle and the expansion on moist conditions was unpredictable.

Plywood joins thin sheets with the grains in crossed directions. Phenolic glues is impermeable to water. The dimensional change with moisture is reduced to about half, to 5%. If dried, plywood may experience cross-grain tension that crack the wood, these cracks may introduce bacteria and moisture.

## Wooden airplanes

"When the loads are relatively small compared to a structure's size it's generally best to introduce rod-like members for compression, and fabric or cords for tension". For example in rigs of sailing ships, tents, windmills, balloons.

> It took quite some time and many lives were lost, before the stressing conditions to which an airplane is subject were sufficiently understood.

As loads increases, the general trend was to hard-skinned monoplanes where the surface takes the load. Compression taken by attached spars and stringers. Aluminum proved similar in structural efficiency with a smoother surface and "almost total elimination of airframe maintenance". By 1939 it was believed that no more wooden airplanes would be built, but shortages in aluminum, skilled workforce and a reduced development time kept production.

Poor hangar conditions and design (bad ventilation and damp boxes) caused rot in wooden airplanes specially in the war. There are about 40 different species of rot and the damage they do is not proportional to appearance. Smelling and shrinkage between components was also a problem, specially in the changing climatic conditions of different countries.

Glued joints testing is difficult, one has to rely on inspection during manufacture. Gluing requires that the interface of the wood is penetrated. The cutting, heat and pressure in manufacturing of wood (case-hardened) leaves the weak (damaged) tubes in the interface. Sandpaper the damaged surface of the plywood to allow the glue deep into the wood.

> Wood does not take kindly to the inevitable abuse of an emergency.

# Chapter 8: Composite materials - or how to make bricks with straw

Straw or plan matter in pottery to prevent cracking when the clay is dried. Considerable strength and toughness of brittle materials is also achieved.

Additions of fibre stop and deflect cracks probably at the interface and the work of fracture is increased. In practice this is equivalent to a substantial improvement in tensile strength. More research is needed.

To compete with traditional materials, the volume of fibre needed is a significant percentage of the composite. This brings problems in manufacturing since a greater percentage (more than 2%) thickens the liquid considerably.

## Papier-maché

Beyond 2% it becomes necessary to add matrix to the fibers instead of fibers to the matrix. 

The methods used to about 1945 were practically unchanged from egyptians. A mould is covered with soap or linseed oil to prevent binding to the mold. Scotch (hide) glue and office paste (starch). Dabble pieces of paper of a hand palm's size in the glue and press them in the mould. Sandpapering and painting (only protection).

Moisture resistance is not great. The process was stuck due to lack of impermeable glue.

## Moulding powders

Hardened bakelite by itself is a brittle substance with no great strength, like natural resins.

Dry powder made with partly set bakelite and short cellulose fibers, usually wood-flour. First commercial moulding (heated steel mould) was made in 1916 for the gear-lever knob for Rolls Royce cars. 

For the powder to flow easily in the mould, the fibers had to be short-length, which resulted in modest improvement in strength and toughness.

> A crack in the resin which encounters a fiber has only to make a shortish detour to get around the head of the fiber.

## Cellulose fiber laminates

For high strength, long fibers are needed the flow in moulds is limited.

In 1920, laminates of cellulose paper or fabric was impregnated with a solution of phenolic resin, usually in alcohol, dried and then press-heated with 15 $MN/m^2$. Originally, most of the paper-based was used for electrical insulation and the fabric-reinforced (being very tough) for cams, gears and bearings. After the last war melamine resins (colourless) came in. Great for table top.

Cellulose laminates' affinity for water can be mitigated by drying. Reduced water content in the resin increases the need for higher pressures in the mould. Good moisture resistance means blocking the hydroxyls in the cellulose which makes it brittle. During the war, attempts were made to replace aluminum sheets with cellulose-reinforced sheets. Shrinking and swelling were the main problems, typically 1% dimensional change, different from other materials.

> Nowadays the use of strong cellulose laminates is almost confined to flat sheets which can be pressed between accurately trued plattens.

## Glass fiber materials

Modern reinforced plastics date from the introduction of inorganic fibers at the end of the war. Initially used for transparency and electrical conductivity for radar domes. The most successful fiber is glass.

Glass fibers are melted in an electrically heated platinum cistern with 200-400 holes at the bottom. About 1/3 to 1/2 are 1/100 of an inch thick (5-10 um). Since the fibers weaken if they stick together, an organic film is applied.

> The greatest tonnage of glass fiber reinforcement is therefore handled as whats is called "chopped strand mat"

A blown preform technique is used of a considerable number of shaped mouldings are required.

Glass fibre has the great advantage of not swelling and high pressures are not required for molding (cheaper and easier to change). Can use phenolic resins but usually it's better with special resins such as polyesters and epoxies. Some methods are similar to papier maché and for large molds (boats) manual molding could be the only practical way to do it.

Reinforced materials were small amounts of fiber that reduce the faults of weak brittle matrix. Newer materials are mainly fibers and the matrix is primarily used to hold them together.

Using fiber-resin ratio 50%:

| Material                           | S.G  | Tensile Strength | Strength for weight | E      | E/S.G |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Parallel fibre glass               | 1.85 | 1000             | 550                 | 35000  | 19000 |
| Crossed fibre glass (woven fabric) | 1.85 | 500              | 280                 | 17000  | 9500  |
| Mild steel                         | 7.8  | 400              | 50                  | 210000 | 27000 |
| High tensile steel                 | 7.8  | 2000             | 260                 | 210000 | 27000 |

Glass is stronger than steel specially for it's weight, but its not as stiff (worse than wood and steel when considering their weight).

If isotropic (same in all directions) strength is wanted 1/3 of the parallel fiber glass can be achieved (1/6 if random). With chopped strand mat it is difficult to achieve a 50% fiber-resin ratio (still more strength for weight than steel).

Main problem is stiffness for large structures.

Fiber glass is pretty tough (10^3 $J/m^2$). As explained in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-crack-stopping-toughness-vs-brittleness) the resin in the interface fractures when a crack encounters a fiber. "The crack will spread along the fiber so that the fiber becomes detached from the matrix". The crack in the resin forks when encountering a fiber, whiteness in fiber-glass are many internal surfaces created by stress (a blow, maybe). The final step in fracturing involves pulling the fibers out of their holes or burrows, which required a lot of friction (the bulk of the energy used).

It is found that the experimental work of fracture corresponds to the theoretical maximum for conventional composited. Using the helical mechanism (George Jeronimidis) has achieved 10^5 $J/m^2$.

Cost of material is higher but the advantage of shaping makes it practical in some applications. Metals are usually inefficient for thin shells (for example, in small boats).

## High stiffness composites and carbon fibers

Main incentive is a requirement for weight-saving specially in aero-space.

Presumably, if one increases the strength of a material, the structure can me bade thinner, reducing the weight. However, this is not the only consideration. Stiffness, which depends on the chemical nature, is one of the main ones.

Members in compression experience "Euler collapse", because of lack of stiffness, when the length is greater than the area. Airplanes are known to break because of flutter (flapping violently in the airstream), which is guarded against by increasing stiffness.

Most engineering materials have a similar specific Young's moduli. Steel, aluminum alloys, magnesium, titanium and wood have competed with each other in the aircraft industry.

> All these high specific modulus materials are normally very weak and brittle, they can usually only be made at very high temperatures and some are toxic.

Only metal is beryllium, but poisonous. Can be made strong, but it's difficult to increase its toughness. Because of the crystalline structure, dislocations are only mobile in 4 planes, however, as explained in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9), we need mobility in 5 planes to be immune from cracks in any angle.

Beryllium oxide, Beryllia (BeO), could be used in fibers, however it is even more toxic than beryllium.

> In the matter of dislocation mobility we require all or nothing. If dislocations are really mobile then we can make a reliably ductile material, like a metal, and do not need to bother with fibres. However, if we do make fibers, then the thing is to avoid any dislocation movement at all. [...]. For this reason beryllium and magnesia are not very suitable as fiber forming material.

Most other materials in the previous table are predominantly covalent bonded so dislocations remain immobile at normal temperatures. They can only be formed with considerable difficulty and at high temperatures. If the substance is not toxic, other ingredients needed most certainly are.

All solids are naturally strong unless they are weakened by defects. In the case of brittle solids there are geometric irregularities that cause stress concentrations. Most of the solids in the table require to form threads which are homogeneous within and smooth without.

1000 C to 3500 C in a corrosive environment makes the manufacturing process energy intensive and costly. They usually fall into  two categories [whiskers](#whiskers) and [continuous fibers](#continuous-fibers)

### Whiskers

> Processes intended to produce high quality whiskers are usually vapour-phase ones, that is to say the ingredients of the reaction are handled as vapours in high temperature furnaces.

It is not difficult to use gasses such us nitrogen or oxygen, however other ingredients such as silicon, carbon and aluminum require a 'transport species' (SiO, SiCl2, CH2, AlO, ...).

When the reaction is speed up, the quality decreases.

Silicon carbide whiskers have been grown and can be bought in England, Switzerland and Japan. Alumina (Sapphire) whiskers from America. The fashion has been for continuos fibers such as carbon fibers.

### Continuous fibers

In the long run whiskers show several advantages, short fibers could be easier to manufacture and the process results in a smoother surface resulting in stronger fibers.

Most commercial whiskers reach a mean elastic breaking strain of 2% at a very high stress. This stress could be employed to increase the work of fracture of the composite. As we shall see, the main flaw in continuos fiber composites of the carbon-fiber type is the work of fracture.


Some modern high-stiffness reinforcing fibres

| --------- | ---- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Boron     | 2.5  | 58         | 400,000 | 450,000              | 3,100                  |

#### Boron

Boron in 1960 America. Thin tungsten (0.013 mm) is electrically heated to 1000 C in an ambient with boron (boron trichloride BCl3 and hydrogen or boron hydride B2H6 and chlorine) which is deposited (0.05 mm) on the tungsten. Have been developed with resin and aluminum alloy matrices and have been used in service aircraft, helicopters and space-travel. Have not caught up for commercial purposes since it is expensive ($700 per kg).

#### Carbon fibers

Carbon fibers of a fragile kind date to the end of the 19th century Edison to make electric lamp filaments by heating bamboo. In 1964 Bill Watt at Farnborough was able to carburize polyacrylonitrile fibers.

Carbon fibers are not particularly strong, they are a little weaker than glass fibers. However, by weight it is around 8 times as stiff as glass or normal engineering metals. They are weak in compression, that could be mitigated by using a metal matrix, however it has not worked in practice because of chemical reactions between the carbon and metals.

Carbon fibers are great where weight is important but strength is not too critical (artificial limbs, golf club shafts or the stiffening of car bodies).

Toughness is a problem for more exacting application, like aircraft parts. The theoretical limit it not high. To increase the toughness one could increase the strength of the fibers or, maybe, by using the George Jeronimidis' timber mechanism, hiving to the fibers a helical geometry.

#### Kevlar 49

Made by Du Pont are benzene rings similar in structure to high grade cellulose such us flax (similar density and modulus). The strength is about 4 times higher and it is immune to moisture and rot. Weight by weight, the stiffness is not as high as boron or carbon-fibers, but it is not too low either.

## Reinforced concrete

The use of steel as reinforcement seems to be Greek. 

Although the Greeks knew about masonry (all materials in compression), they did not use arches, maybe for aesthetics.

> The Parthenon and all other Doric temples are an exact copy in marble of wooden buildings.

Wooden architecture is an mainly about beams since wood is available in long pieces and has good tensile strength. In the early Doric stone temples the tensile weakness of marble was mitigated by using short beams and wide capitals at the head of the colum.

> Greek colonists at Akragas (Agrigentum) in Sicily were using iron reinforcing members fifteen feet long and of five to twelve-inch cross-section as early as 470 B.C. How such large forgings were made is a mystery and it suggests that the greeks would have had no technological difficulty in making steam engines and other heavy machinery [...]. 

Frenchman Soufflot (1713-81) tried to increase the tensile strength of masonry by burying iron rods in the joints between the stonework. "The wet got in along the mortar and rusted the iron, the expansion of the corrosion products then crumbled the masonry."

Three people almost simultaneously discovered that iron reinforcement in Portland cement did not rust sufficiently to cause damage. A French gardener, Joseph Monier (1823-1906), an englishman W. B. Wilkinson and a French engineer J. L. Lambot (patented).

"Tensile breaking strain of concrete is low so that it cracks long before the iron is seriously strained". If small cracks appear in the concrete, they let water in, if they are large, the concrete may fall out piecemeal. The best way to avoid this is by putting the concrete in compression by tensing the steel reinforcement. Prestressed concrete began in 1890. It enables much more efficient and highly stressed structures to be built than were possible.

Steel does not take the compression, it's stabilized against buckling and is protected from rust.

Modern fracture mechanics theory has been applied to the problem, resulting in fine-scale reinforcement (similar to reinforced plastics). Usually a steel wire or glass fiber.
