Perhaps is physics greater mystery.

We think the events pass in an orderly way, past, present, future. The past is fixes the future opens. Yet this has turned out to be wrong.
What we call time is a collection of structures, layers.

We are left with a world without temporality. Quantum gravity is an attempt to understand this landscape, a world without time.
Somehow time must emerge around us.

The mystery is perhaps more about ourselves.

# Part 1: The crumbing of time

# 1. Loss of unity

## The slowing down of time
Time passes faster in a mountain than it does at sea level.

Someone understood the pass of time before we were able to measure it. Albert Einstein. He imagined that the sun and earth do not interact between them, but modify the structure of what is in between (space and time). 

The earth is a mass and slows down time in its vicinity.
Things fall downward because down there, Time is slowed by the earth

## Ten thousand dancing shivas
The whole of sciences is about haw things develop according to the order of time.

There is not a single time. Proper time is the time associated with a clock. Einstein has shown how proper times develop relative to each other. Physics describes the evolution of things in their own times and how times evolve relative to each other

Time has lost its unity.

# 2. Loss of direction

Where does the eternal current come from?

> What distinguishes the past, it's having been, from the future, its not having been yet, in the folds of the mechanism of the world?
In the elementary laws that describe the mechanism of the world, there is no such difference

## Heat
Parish 1793, rebellion is perhaps among the deepest roots of science: the refusal to accept the present order of things
> Saadi Shirazi: all of the sons of Adam are part of one single body, They are of the same essence. When time afflicts us with pain In one part of that body All the other parts feel it too. If you fail to feel the pain of others You do not deserve the name of man

Said Carnot develops a passion for steam engines. In 1824 writes "Reflection on the motive power of fire"
Heat cannot pass from hot to cold, Rudolf Clausius. A ball may fall and go back up. Heat cannot.

Only basic law of physics that distinguishes past from the future. Only when there is heat there is a distinction, a ball slowing down by friction.

Entropy from the Greek word of transformation. "I prefer to take the names in important scientific quantities from ancient languages, so that they may be the same kn all living languages"

$$ \Delta S >= 0 $$ 

## Blur

Carnot thought that heat was a fluid, what it is the microscopic agitation of molecules.

At the end of the 19th century there were many who did not believe in the existence of molecules and atoms. Ludwig Boltzmann was convinced.

The growth of entropy is nothing but the ubiquitous and natural increase in disorder. The definition of entropy requires coarse granting, the distinction between macrostates and microstates. The entropy of a macrostate is determined by the number of corresponding microstates. Volume and pressure of a gas are macroscopic variables.

The notion of particularity is born only when be see the universe in a blurred and approximate way.
It is only in the blurred, statistical, vision that there is a difference between past and future.

Our perception of the passage of time depends on the fact that we cannot apprehend the world in all it's minute detail?

$$ S = k * log(W) $$ 

W is the number of microscopic states, k is Boltzmann's constant.

> Time has lost another of its crucial components: the intrinsic difference between past and future.
