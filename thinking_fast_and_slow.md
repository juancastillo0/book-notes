System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects. Uncertainty and doubt are the domain of System 2.

### A Bias to Believe and Confirm

Daniel Gilbert from Baruch Spinoza 17th century: believing involves an intuitive representation by System 1 and "unbelieving" an operation of System 2.

Experiment: Sentences followed by "true" or "false", people tend to believe when they are occupying their System 2 (hold digits in memory). It was harder to "unbelieve". People will be more influenced (commercials) when they are tired.

Associative memory brings a general confirmation bias. You search for evidence based on the question ("Is Sam [un]friendly?"). Positive search strategy, the opposite to testing hypothesis by trying to refute them. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favours uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggerates the likelihood of events.

### Exaggerated Emotional Coherence (Halo Effect)

Tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person. System 1 makes the world simpler and more coherent.

Experiment:
- Alan: Intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious
- Ben: envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent

The initial traits of the list change the meaning of the following traits. Suppressed ambiguity intelligent->stubborn and stubborn->intelligent stubborn could be good or bad (one makes it coherent for the context).

Decorrelate error. Predictions averaged over a large number of observers can lower the error if there are no systematic biases and their errors are independent (if dependent they lower the effective population size). Witnesses con influence each other. In a meeting write a summary of your proposal before discussing to reduce dependence.

## What you see is all there is (WYSIATI)

System 1 incorporates ideas that are activated, but it can't use ones that it doesn't have. Success is coherence within the currently activated ideas. 

"Will Mindik be a good leader? She is intelligent and strong..." What if the next adjective where corrupt. You did not ask what is required to be a good leader, you jump to conclusion.

People who are shown one side of a story are more confident. "It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness". 90% fat-free or 10% fat (you see one formulation).

Overconfidence, framing effects, base-rate neglect (farmer or librarian), others.

## Speaking of jumping to conclusions

- "All she is going by is the halo effect from a good presentation."
- "Let's decorrelate errors by obtaining separate judgments on the issue before any discussion."
- "What you see is all there is (WYSIATI), they did not seem to realize how little information they had."
- "They did not want more information that might spoil their story (WYSIATI)."


# Chapter 8: How Judgement Happen

System 2 directs attention and searches memory. System 1 continuously generates assessments without intention nor effort. 

## Basic Assessments

Evolution provided System 1 with a constant assessment of the environment and the threat level. "Good mood and cognitive ease are assessments of safety and familiarity".

Assessing strangers by dominance and trustworthiness (Alex Todorov).

Experiment: show faces for fractions of a second and predict competence and likability. 70% of predictions for higher competence correspond to an elected official. Competence is strength and trustworthiness.

Judgment heuristic, assessment on simpler questions (perceived competence) is used to solve difficult questions (performance in office).

Poorly informed people are more prone to the automatic preference of System 1.

These assessments include similarity and representativeness, attributions of causality, and evaluations of associations.

### Sets and Prototypes

"System 1 represents categories by prototypes or a set of typical exemplars, it deals with averages but poorly with sums".

Experiment: Following an oil spill, participants were asked to say how much they would give to save 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds. The groups said 80$, 78$, 88$. The number of birds made no difference, they reacted to a prototype.

### Intensity Matching

Translating between different scales y making comparisons, can result in statistical errors. "Julie read fluently when she was four years old" -> "How rall is a man who is as tall as Julie was precocious".

### The Mental Shotgun

We often compute much more than we want or need.

Experiment: Tell whether the words rhyme 
VOTE-NOTE
VOTE-GOAT

Both rhyme, but VOTE-GOAT is answered much slowly because of the different spelling. The computation of the spelling is detrimental to the task.

Combination of intensity matching and mental shotgun explains why be have judgments about things we know little about.

## Speaking of Judgement

- "You evaluate attractiveness automatically, it is a basic assessment and it influences you."
- "The brain evaluates dominance from the shape of the face."
- "The punishment won't feel just unless its intensity matches the crime."
- "He was asked for the financial status of the company but he couldn't forget that he likes their product."
