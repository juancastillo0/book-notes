# Part I: Two Systems

# Chapter 1: The Characters of the Story

# Chapter 2: Attention and Effort

Alternative definitions

- Intelligence: Logic
- Rationality: System 2 attention

Self-control, Attention, System 2.

Glucose. Judges are more accepting right after they eat.

# Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

Active in deliberate memory search, complex computations, comparisons, planning. Self criticism.

# Chapter 4: The Associative Machine

# Chapter 5: Cognitive Ease

Creativity in System 1.

# Chapter 6: Norms, Surprises, and Causes

# Chapter 7: A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects. Uncertainty and doubt are the domain of System 2.

### A Bias to Believe and Confirm

Daniel Gilbert from Baruch Spinoza 17th century: believing involves an intuitive representation by System 1 and "unbelieving" an operation of System 2.

Experiment: Sentences followed by "true" or "false", people tend to believe when they are occupying their System 2 (hold digits in memory). It was harder to "unbelieve". People will be more influenced (commercials) when they are tired.

Associative memory brings a general confirmation bias. You search for evidence based on the question ("Is Sam [un]friendly?"). Positive search strategy, the opposite to testing hypothesis by trying to refute them. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favours uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggerates the likelihood of events.

### Exaggerated Emotional Coherence (Halo Effect)

Tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person. System 1 makes the world simpler and more coherent.

Experiment:
- Alan: Intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious
- Ben: envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent

The initial traits of the list change the meaning of the following traits. Suppressed ambiguity intelligent->stubborn and stubborn->intelligent stubborn could be good or bad (one makes it coherent for the context).

Decorrelate error. Predictions averaged over a large number of observers can lower the error if there are no systematic biases and their errors are independent (if dependent they lower the effective population size). Witnesses con influence each other. In a meeting write a summary of your proposal before discussing to reduce dependence.

## What you see is all there is (WYSIATI)

System 1 incorporates ideas that are activated, but it can't use ones that it doesn't have. Success is coherence within the currently activated ideas. 

"Will Mindik be a good leader? She is intelligent and strong..." What if the next adjective where corrupt. You did not ask what is required to be a good leader, you jump to conclusion.

People who are shown one side of a story are more confident. "It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness". 90% fat-free or 10% fat (you see one formulation).

Overconfidence, framing effects, base-rate neglect (farmer or librarian), others.

## Speaking of Jumping to Conclusions

- "All she is going by is the halo effect from a good presentation."
- "Let's decorrelate errors by obtaining separate judgments on the issue before any discussion."
- "What you see is all there is (WYSIATI), they did not seem to realize how little information they had."
- "They did not want more information that might spoil their story (WYSIATI)."


# Chapter 8: How Judgement Happen

System 2 directs attention and searches memory. System 1 continuously generates assessments without intention nor effort. 

## Basic Assessments

Evolution provided System 1 with a constant assessment of the environment and the threat level. "Good mood and cognitive ease are assessments of safety and familiarity".

Assessing strangers by dominance and trustworthiness (Alex Todorov).

Experiment: show faces for fractions of a second and predict competence and likability. 70% of predictions for higher competence correspond to an elected official. Competence is strength and trustworthiness.

Judgment heuristic, assessment on simpler questions (perceived competence) is used to solve difficult questions (performance in office).

Poorly informed people are more prone to the automatic preference of System 1.

These assessments include similarity and representativeness, attributions of causality, and evaluations of associations.

### Sets and Prototypes

> System 1 represents categories by prototypes or a set of typical exemplars. It deals with averages, but poorly with sums.

Experiment: Following an oil spill, participants were asked to say how much they would give to save 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds. The groups said 80\$, 78\$, 88\$. The number of birds made no difference, they reacted to a prototype.

### Intensity Matching

Translating between different scales y making comparisons, can result in statistical errors. "Julie read fluently when she was four years old" -> "How rall is a man who is as tall as Julie was precocious".

### The Mental Shotgun

We often compute much more than we want or need.

Experiment: Tell whether the words rhyme 
- VOTE-NOTE
- VOTE-GOAT

Both rhyme, but VOTE-GOAT is answered much slowly because of the different spelling. The computation of the spelling is detrimental to the task.

Combination of intensity matching and mental shotgun explains why be have judgments about things we know little about.

## Speaking of Judgement

- "You evaluate attractiveness automatically, it is a basic assessment and it influences you."
- "The brain evaluates dominance from the shape of the face."
- "The punishment won't feel just unless its intensity matches the crime."
- "He was asked for the financial status of the company but he couldn't forget that he likes their product."

# Chapter 9: Answering an Easier Question

"The normal state of mind is that you have intuitive feeling about almost everything".

## Substituting Questions

If there is no satisfactory answer to a complex question, System 1 will find and related, simpler question and answer it in place.

- "How happy are you with your life these days" -> "What is my mood right now?"
- "How should financial advisers who prey on the elderly be punished?" -> "How much anger do I feel when I think of financial predators?"

**Intensity matching** is performed when the answer to the simpler question must be matched to the original question (have different units or scales).

## The 3-D Heuristic

An 2-D [image](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+heuristic+illusion&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCO945CO945&hl=en&sxsrf=ALiCzsY-RdzZrPPF5aYYq7hD_vFv8OE4pQ:1656279797943&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj244SIi8z4AhUUQzABHazHBKoQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1440&bih=764&dpr=2#imgrc=B7M-b0x5cRoFvM) is show with 3-D perspective, the last person appears to be bigger. 

> A judgment that is based on substitution will inevitably be biased in predictable ways

## The Mood Heuristic for Happiness

Experiment:
- How happy are you these days?
- How many dates did you have last month?

No correlation between the answers. However, if you reverse the order the correlation between number of dates and happiness was high. When answering for happiness, they already had an answer for a related question (dates). What you see is all there is (WYSIATI).

## The Affect Heuristic

Primacy of conclusions is more pronounces with emotions. Your likes and dislikes drives your beliefs. 

> In the context of attitudes System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions - an endorser rather than an enforcer.

The search for information is constraint by existing beliefs.

## Speaking of Substitution and Heuristics

- "The question we face is whether this candidate can succeed. The question  we seem to answer is whether she interviews well. Let's not substitute."
- "He likes the project, si he thinks its costs are low and its benefits are high. Nice example of the affect heuristic."

# Part II: Heuristics and Biases

# Chapter 10: The Law of Small Numbers

A study of 3141 counties in US reveals a remarkable pattern. Countries with lowest incidence of kidney cancer are rural and traditionally republican. It is easy to infer that the low incidence is because of a rural lifestyle (no pollution, fresh food). However the counties where the incidence is highest are also rural and traditionally republican. You could argue that it is because of poverty and no medical care. The key factor is that rural counties have small populations.

Samples of 4 marbles yield more extreme results (all same color) than samples of 7 marbles. The probabilities are 12.5% vs 1.56%)

> System 1 is highly adept in one form of thinking —it automatically and effortlessly identifies causal connections between events. [...]. As we shall see, System 1 is inept when faced with "merely statistical" facts, which change the probability of outcomes but do not cause them to happen.

"Large samples are more precise than small samples" is equivalent to "Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do".

## The Law of Small Numbers

In 1970 it was thought that people were "intuitive statisticians".

> Researchers who pick too small a sample leave themselves at the mercy of sampling luck

> Like most research psychologists, I had routinely chosen samples that were too small and had often obtained results that made no sense.

Responses from a meeting at the Society of Mathematical Psychology showed that most people (event authors of statistical textbooks) make the same mistakes, even experts paid insufficient attention to sample size.

## A Bias of Confidence Over Doubt

One may not react different to sample sizes 150 or 3000.

Naturally you focus on the story rather that the reliability of the result. "Can your System 1 distinguish degrees of belief? The principle of WYSIATI suggests that it cannot." It suppresses ambiguity and searches for consistency.

System 2 is capable of doubt, however it's easier to be certain. The law of small numbers is a manifestation of a general bias that favours certainty over doubt.

## Cause and Chance

The associative machine seeks causes, however statistical regularities call for a different approach. Nothing in particular cause it to be what it is.

Experiment: Sequences of births B -> boy, G -> girl
- BBBGGG
- GGGGGG
- BGBBGB

Each is equally likely. 6 girls in a row seems unlikely.

There could be an evolutionary advantage in assuming causality.

> We are on the lookout for the possibility that the environment has changed. Lions may appear on the plain at random times, but it would be safer to notice and respond to an apparent increase in the rate of appearance of pride of lions.

> To the untrained eye, randomness appears as regularity or tendency to the cluster.
> 
> \- William Feller

Bombing in England WW2, death of pilots from a specific squadron, "hot hands" in basketball. One perceives order and causality from randomness.

When using your intuition you are more likely to classify a random event as systematic.

Huge research investment has been allocated to finding what makes a better school. One of the conclusion of this research is that the most successful schools were small. This probably makes intuitive sense and we are ready to search for causes and explanations. However, worse school also tend to be smaller. "The truth is that small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable".

The law of small numbers is part of two larger stories about the workings of the mind:
- "We pay more attention to the content of messages than to information about their reliability"
- "Statistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations."

## Speaking of the Law of Small Numbers

- "Yes, the studio has had three successful films since the new CEO took over. But it is too early to declare he has a hot hand."
- "The sample of observations is too small to make any inferences. Let's not follow the law of small numbers."


# 11. Anchoring

People anchor thought when adjusting system 2 and as a priming effect system 1

When adjusting one typically underestimates the necessary adjustment. One stops early. You are likely to stop when you are not sure you should keep adjusting.
Adjusting is an effortful operation. People do it less when tired or drunk. It is a way of finding out reasons to keep adjusting. When people nod, they are more likely to go further.

Suggestions causes us to think about something when we feel it. Your associate machinery generates impressions based on suggestions. Your system 1 thinks by believing. Selective activation of compatible memories. Asking about average price car when suggesting high-end brands vs low-end ones.

Asking price for real state results in anchoring of suggested price, even for experts. Can be a random anchoring suggestion. Rolling dice for judges and prison time in months.

Arbitrary rationing in supper markets (only 12 per person) results in more purchase.
In negotiations, if the other party makes na outrageous proposal, make sure that both agree that the negotiation will not consider that proposal. Thinking the opposite and searching for reasons to oppose or focusing on the minimal offer or the cost to the opponent of not reaching the argument.

Placing limits could result on anchoring toward the potentially high limit

T Anchoring and the two systems
A message unless immediately rejected as a lie will have an effect on the associative system.

- "our aim in the negotiation is to get them anchored on this number"
- "the firm we want to acquire set us the revenues they expect, we should not anchor on that.


# 12. The science of availability

The availability heuristic substitute one question for another. You estimate the size of a category or the frequency of events with the impression of the ease with which instances come to mind.

Salient event that attract your attention will be easily retrieved from memory.
Dramatic events temporarily increase the availability. Car or plane accidents.
Personal experience are more available that statistics or stories from others.

One must make an effort to think about the possible events that may increase the availability 

Marriages or joint projects. One remembers their own contribution much more clearly, it is more available. The frequency of contribution is biased.
Also happens for negative events (initiation of conflicts) but to a lesser extent. 
You are likely to feel that you have done more than your share even when other people feel the same.

T The psychology of availability

Experiments on availability by listing instances show that 2 things matter for the effect on availability 
- The number of instances retrieved
- the easy with which they come to mind

4 very easy instances is better that 12 hard to find instances.

Frowning accompanies cognitive strain and the result is symmetric. If one frowns while searching for instances they will appear to be more difficult to access.
Paradoxical results arise.
People are less confident on a choice when they are asked to produce mor arguments to support it.
They believe they use their bicycle less often after recalling many rather than few instances.

Students who list many ways to improve the class rated it higher.

The drop in fluency between 6 and 12 instances appears to be higher than what participants expected. 

Experiments show that the effect on judgement of the fluency of retrieval can be reverted by providing explanations for the fluency. Background music that is said to make retrieval more difficult.
It's the unexpectedly low fluency that causes people to describe themselves as unassertive after 12 instances. If the surprise is removed, low fluency no longer influences judgement.

System 2 can reset expectations of system 1 so that an events that appeared surprising is now almost normal.

Personal experience increases the weight put into the amount of instances vs the fluency.

The ease with which instances come to mind are a system 1 heuristic, which is replaced by a focus on content (quantity of instances) when the system 2 is more engaged.
