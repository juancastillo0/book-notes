System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects. Uncertainty and doubt are the domain of System 2.

### A Bias to Believe and Confirm

Daniel Gilbert from Baruch Spinoza 17th century: believing involves an intuitive representation by System 1 and "unbelieving" an operation of System 2.

Experiment: Sentences followed by "true" or "false", people tend to believe when they are occupying their System 2 (hold digits in memory). It was harder to "unbelieve". People will be more influenced (commercials) when they are tired.

Associative memory brings a general confirmation bias. You search for evidence based on the question ("Is Sam [un]friendly?"). Positive search strategy, the opposite to testing hypothesis by trying to refute them. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favours uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggerates the likelihood of events.

### Exaggerated Emotional Coherence (Halo Effect)

Tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person. System 1 makes the world simpler and more coherent.

Experiment:
- Alan: Intelligent-industrious-impulsive-critical-stubborn-envious
- Ben: envious-stubborn-critical-impulsive-industrious-intelligent

The initial traits of the list change the meaning of the following traits. Suppressed ambiguity intelligent->stubborn and stubborn->intelligent stubborn could be good or bad (one makes it coherent for the context).

Decorrelate error. Predictions averaged over a large number of observers can lower the error if there are no systematic biases and their errors are independent (if dependent they lower the effective population size). Witnesses con influence each other. In a meeting write a summary of your proposal before discussing to reduce dependence.

## What you see is all there is (WYSIATI)

System 1 incorporates ideas that are activated, but it can't use ones that it doesn't have. Success is coherence within the currently activated ideas. 

"Will Mindik be a good leader? She is intelligent and strong..." What if the next adjective where corrupt. You did not ask what is required to be a good leader, you jump to conclusion.

People who are shown one side of a story are more confident. "It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness". 90% fat-free or 10% fat (you see one formulation).

Overconfidence, framing effects, base-rate neglect (farmer or librarian), others.

## Speaking of jumping to conclusions

- "All she is going by is the halo effect from a good presentation."
- "Let's decorrelate errors by obtaining separate judgments on the issue before any discussion."
- "What you see is all there is (WYSIATI), they did not seem to realize how little information they had."
- "They did not want more information that might spoil their story (WYSIATI)."
